<TITLE>LUCAS SEES CONTINUED GROWTH IN SECOND HALF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lucas Industries Plc &lt;LUCS.L&gt; said its
underlying performance would continue to improve in the second
half but profits would be restrained by low activity in U.K.
Commercial vehicle and tractor markets as well as in North
American electronics.
    The company earlier reported a two mln stg rise in pretax
profit to 40 mln in the six months to end-January. The figure
was some five mln below forecasts and Lucas shares dropped
sharply to 557.5p at 1130 GMT from last night's close of 590p.
    It said it would continue with plans for all its activities
to be internationally competitive and profitable.
    Costs of restructuring, reorganisation, employee training
and retraining, particularly in the UK automotive businesses,
together with high research and development spending would
affect profits in the short term.
    But Lucas said it was exploiting growth opportunities in
automotive markets, especially in vehicle breaking and engine
management systems. Recent acquisitions in North America had
strengthened Lucas Aerospace and Lucas Industrial systems.
