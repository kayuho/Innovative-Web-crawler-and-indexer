<TITLE>NOVA &lt;NOVX&gt; TO GET BRADYKININ ANTAGONIST PATENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BALTIMORE, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nova Pharmaceutical Corp said the
U.S. Patent Office has allowed its patent for bradykinin
antagonist drugs. Nova said patents have also been filed in
other countries worldwide.
    It said it has the exclusive worldwide rights to these
patents for the first bradykinin blocking drugs being developed
as topical pain relievers and in nasal spry form for treating
common cold symptoms.
    Nova said Bradykinin is the most powerful paing-producing
substance in the body and is considered, based on scientific
evidence, to be the initial stimulus of pain.
