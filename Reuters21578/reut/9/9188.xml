<TITLE>VEBA PLACEMENT CONTINUES FOR SMALL SHAREHOLDERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The placement of 10.1 mln government
owned shares in Veba AG &lt;VEBG.F&gt; is still open for small
shareholders but lead manager Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F&gt; has
already closed its books for institutional investors, a
Deutsche spokesman said in answer to queries.
    Under the terms of the placement which opened on Monday,
small shareholders were given priority for three days so that
this privilege will not lapse until close of business today.
    Consortium banks set aside fixed amounts for small
shareholders. The spokesman could not say how big these were,
or whether other banks had closed books for institutions.
