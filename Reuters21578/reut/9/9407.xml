<TITLE>CATERPILLAR &lt;CAT&gt; WORKERS TOLD TO END SIT-IN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GLASGOW, Scotland, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Caterpillar Tractor
Co was granted a court injunction ordering some 300 workers to
end their 10-week occupation of the firm's factory, court
sources said.
    The workers, staging a sit-in to protest Caterpillar's
decision to close the plant with the loss of 1,221 jobs, are
due to decide on their next step at a mass meeting tonight.
    Yesterday a spokesman for the workers said they would
comply with the law if forced out.
    Caterpillar wants to dismiss the workforce and close the
plant in May.
