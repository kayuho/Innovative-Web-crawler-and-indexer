<TITLE>SWIRE PLANS BONUS ISSUE ON HIGHER 1986 PROFITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HKG&gt; said it
plans for a one-for-five bonus issue for both its "A" and "B"
shares following an earlier report of a 44.7 pct jump in 1986
net profits to 1.78 billion H.K. Dlrs.
    The company also announced final dividends of 44 cents per
"A" share and 8.8 cents per "B" share against 32.3 and 6.5 cents a
year ago.
    It recorded extraordinary gains of 1.38 billion dlrs which
mainly derived from the sale in April of a 15.75 pct stake in
Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HKG&gt; in line with the
floatation of the airline.
