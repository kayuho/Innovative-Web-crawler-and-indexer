<TITLE>CHINA'S PREMIER ZHAO SAYS POLITICAL CRISIS OVER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang said the
threat from western political ideas which caused widespread
student demonstrations last December has been curbed.
    In an address at the opening session of China's parliament,
the National People's Congress, he accused unnamed party
leaders of being weak and lax in their supervision of ideology
and of failing to give full support to the promotion of
Marxism.
    "After several months of work since the end of last year we
have curbed bourgeois liberalisation, which was once quite
widespread," he said.
