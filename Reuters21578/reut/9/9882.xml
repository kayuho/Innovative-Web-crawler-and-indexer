<TITLE>LIBYA ABANDONS CHAD STRONGHOLD AFTER DEFEATS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 26 -  </DATELINE><BODY>Libyan troops are hastily evacuating
their last important stronghold in northern Chad, leaving the
key desert oasis undefended against advancing Chad government
troops, military and diplomatic sources said.
    They said a Libyan force of some 3,000 men was abandoning
the oasis of Faya-Largeau but added that severe sand storms
across Chad could be delaying the pull out and an expected
government strike on the town.
    Swirling clouds of sand, which have closed the capital of
N'Djamena to commercial flights for two days, have sharply
reduced visibility and made it difficult to determine the exact
situation around Faya, French military officials said.
    The hurried Libyan evacuation, which started yesterday
morning, follows the capture on Sunday of Libya's best-defended
and vitally important air base at Ouadi Doum, 145 kms (90
miles) northeast of Faya.
    The fall of Ouadi Doum, which Chad said cost 1,269 Libyan
lives, deprived Libya of its only hard surface runway in Chad
capable of taking Soviet-made bombers and transport planes and
left Faya-Largeau isolated and encircled by government troops.
    Libyan forces are reported to have blown up stocks of fuel
and ammunition on Tuesday night before starting to flee
northwards towards the Tibesti mountain region, which adjoins
Libya's southern border.
