finalizing arrangements with Union Carbide &lt;UK&gt; of the United
States and Snamprogetti of Italy for the construction of a
1,500 tonnes per day methanol plant, Energy Minister Kelvin

    Ramnath said the ministry is now holding talks with Union
Carbide on the price of natural gas to be used in the plant,
which will be constructed near the Trinidad and Tobago oil
