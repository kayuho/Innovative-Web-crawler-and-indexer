<TITLE>STANDARD &lt;SRD&gt; REFERRING BP &lt;BP&gt; BID TO GROUP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CLEVELAND, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard Oil Co said British
Petroleum Co Plc's proposed offer of 70 dlrs a share for the 45
pct of Standard's stock not held by BP is being referred to a
special committee of the company's board.
    This committee, which is composed of the independent,
non-exective directors of the company, was formed in April 1986
for the purpose of monitoring the relationship between Standard
Oil and BP.

and Cravath Swaine and Moore as advisers.
