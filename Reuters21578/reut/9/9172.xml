<TITLE>GUINNESS SEEKS U.K. INJUNCTION AGAINST SAUNDERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Guinness Plc &lt;GUIN.L&gt; will seek an
injunction in the U.K. High Court today to freeze the assets of
former Chairman Ernest Saunders in its attempts to recover 5.2
mln stg paid to a Jersey company as part of the company's
takeover battle for &lt;Distillers Co Plc&gt;, a spokesman said.
    He said the court move aimed to freeze Saunders' assets up
to the value of the sum it wanted to recover. It was uncertain
whether the court would reach any decision on the request
today. Guinness said last week it planned to take legal action
to recover the funds, paid to non-executive director Thomas
Ward via the Jersey company.
    Lawyers representing Ward have said he saw the funds as his
reward for services performed during the takeover of
Distillers.
    Guinness is also planning a resolution at the annual
meeting in May to remove both Saunders and Ward from the
company's board.
