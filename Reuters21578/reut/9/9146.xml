<TITLE>TWO JAPANESE STEELMAKERS TO CUT CAPITAL SPENDING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nippon Steel Corp &lt;NSTC.TOK&gt; said it will
cut its capital spending by 36.4 pct to 105 billion yen in the
year starting April 1 from a year earlier due to the
postponement of furnace improvements.
    &lt;Nisshin Steel Co Ltd&gt; said it will spend 10.7 billion yen
in 1987/88 for rationalisation and facility improvements, down
from 32.1 billion a year earlier, after completion of large
construction projects in 1986/87.
    But capital spending by Nippon Kokan K.K. &lt;NKKT.TOK&gt; to
improve and increase its production facilities will rise to
94.90 billion yen from 64 billion, the company said.
