<TITLE>THAI SUGAR PRODUCTION CONTINUES HIGH IN FEB</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thai sugar production continued at a
high level in February, latest figures received by the
International Sugar Organization (ISO) show.
    The figures show stocks at end-February of 2.49 mln tonnes
raw value against 2.33 mln a year earlier. Analysts said this
was a new peak for the date.
    Production in February was 961,000 tonnes against 888,000
in February 1986 and took the Nov/Feb total for the current
crop to 2.25 mln tonnes. Production normally tails off sharply
after March, but in recent years production from March to the
end of the crop has been over 500,000 tonnes, analysts said.
    Thailand's exports in February were 32,800 tonnes and
consumption 57,800.
    Last month the Thai Agriculture Ministry said 1986/87
production was expected to fall to 2.3 mln tonnes from 2.48 mln
in 1985/86.
