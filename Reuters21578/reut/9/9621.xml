<TITLE>LITTLE SUPPORT FOR MANDATORY ACREAGE CUTS - LYNG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said he believes proposed legislation calling for
mandatory acreage reductions has little support in Congress and
voiced Reagan administration opposition to it.
    "The administration would be very much opposed to that
legislation," he told a Virginia Farm Bureau lunch.
    "But fortunately I don't detect a strong interest in that
legislation." He added, "I doubt there will be (enough) support
to get it out."
    The controversial bill, supported by Representative Richard
Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, calls for a national referendum
to be conducted that could result in mandatory unpaid acreage
cuts of up to 35 pct, paid land diversion beyond that level if
necessary and a marketing quota.
