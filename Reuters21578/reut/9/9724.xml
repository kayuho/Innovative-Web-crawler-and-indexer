<TITLE>AIDC ISSUES FIRST AUSTRALIAN DLR MEDIUM TERM NOTES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CANBERRA, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Australian Industry Development
Corp (AIDC) said it issued 20 mln Australian dlrs of five-year
notes in London.
    The notes, issued in denominations of 50,000 dlrs, were
part of a 10-year, one billion U.S. Dlr multicurrency facility
established last December, it said in a statement.
    Medium-term Euronotes had previously only been issued in
U.S. Dlrs, it said.
    The AIDC last week said it issued under the same facility
the first of several five mln Australian dlr-denominated
Euro-commercial paper tranches in Asia.
    Dealers for the one billion U.S. Dlr borrowing program were
the AIDC, &lt;Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd&gt;, &lt;Merrill Lynch
International and Co&gt;, &lt;Morgan Stanley International&gt;, &lt;Salomon
Brothers International Ltd&gt; and &lt;Swiss Bank Corp International
Ltd&gt;, the AIDC said.
    &lt;Citibank N.A.&gt; was the issuing and paying agent.
