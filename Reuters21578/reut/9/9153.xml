<TITLE>VIETNAM TO RESETTLE 300,000 ON STATE FARMS IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Vietnam will resettle 300,000 people on
state farms known as new economic zones in 1987, to create jobs
and grow more high-value export crops, the communist party
newspaper Nhan Dan said.
    Yesterday's edition, received here today, said Vietnam
would invest one billion dong, including the costs of
relocation, in 272 new economic zones. About one third of that
sum would be spent on export crops such as coffee, tea, rubber
and pepper in the Central Highlands, it said.
    Since 1975, Vietnam has resettled about three million
people from cities and crowded river deltas to the zones.
