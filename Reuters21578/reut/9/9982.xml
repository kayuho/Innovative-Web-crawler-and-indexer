<TITLE>U.S. SENATE HITS EC OILS TAX, VOWS RETALIATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Senate voted to condemn the
proposed European common market tax on vegetable and fish fats
and oils and said it would result in retaliation.
    The non binding Senate resolution, a sense of Senate
sentiment, was approved on a 99 to 0 vote.
    "The administration should communciate to the European
Community the message that the United States will view the
establishment of such a tax as inconsistent with the European
Community's obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade that will result in the adoption of strong and
immediate countermeasures," the resolution stated.
