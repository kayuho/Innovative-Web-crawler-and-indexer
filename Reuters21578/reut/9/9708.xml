<TITLE>PACIFIC DUNLOP ANNOUNCES AIDS PROTECTION DISCOVERY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MELBOURNE, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pacific Dunlop Ltd &lt;PACA.ME&gt; said
studies by its &lt;Ansell International&gt; latex-product unit have
shown a commonly-used spermicidal cream kills the AIDS virus.
    Ansell regional director Chris Humphrey told a news
conference the cream, already used in a condom brand as
additional contraceptive protection, killed on contact the
virus causing AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome).
    The discovery meant sexually active people could have a
second level of protection against AIDS if a condom ruptured
during sex, Humphrey said. "This is the best available
protection against AIDS next to abstinence," he said.
    But David Pennington, the head of Australia's government
sponsored AIDS taskforce, said the use of the cream provided a
slight safeguard but was no great breakthrough.
    Pennington said that in the event of a condom rupturing
semen was likely to travel beyond the cream's range.
    Humphrey said the studies, commissioned by Ansell from
Nelson Gantz of the University of Massachusetts and Fred Judson
of the University of Colorado, showed nonoxynol-nine destroyed
the AIDS virus present in 100 pct of rupture tests.
    But he said it was not known whether nonoxynol-nine was as
effective in sexual situations.
    He stressed it was neither a cure nor a vaccine for AIDS.
    Humphrey said nonoxynol-nine had been used for about 20
years as a spermicidal cream without side-effects.
    Analysts have attributed much of the rise in Pacific
Dunlop's share price from 3.87 dlrs at the beginning of the
year to a high of 5.36 dlrs to expected growth in its condom
business. It closed today eight cents down at 4.67 dlrs.
