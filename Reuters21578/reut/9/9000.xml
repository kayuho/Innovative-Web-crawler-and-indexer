<TITLE>S/P MAY DOWNGRADE MARK IV INDUSTRIES &lt;IV&gt; DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it may
downgrade Mark IV Industries Inc's 200 mln dlrs of B-minus
subordinated debt.
    S and P cited the firm's tender offer to acquire Conrac
Corp &lt;CAX&gt; for 152.5 mln dlrs. Conrac has no rated debt.
    Although Mark IV has an overall favorable business
standing, the acquisition would impair earnings and cash flow
protection, S and P said.
    S and P pointed out that debt leverage would rise to about
90 pct, assuming total debt financing. It said it will review
the company's management strategy and financial plans.
