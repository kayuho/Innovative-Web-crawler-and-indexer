<TITLE>ANCHOR SAVINGS BANK OFFERING FULLY SUBSCRIBED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Anchor Savings Bank said its
subscription offering was fully subscribed, precluding an
underwritten public offering of Anchor stock.
    The company, which will be traded on Nasdaq under the
symbol &lt;ABKR&gt;, said final tabulation has not been completed.
    The offering was made in connection with Anchor's
conversion from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a
federally chartered stock savings bank, it said.
    The bank offered 15.3 mln shares of common stock at 8.50
dlrs to 11.50 dlrs a share, with the possible issuance of up to
an additional 2,295,000 shares, it said.
    The company said trading in the bank stock will not
commence until all regulatory requirements have been completed.
    Anchor said it had total assets of 7.3 billion dlrs as of
June 30, 1986.
    It said shares were offered to bank depositors, borrowers
and through a direct mail campaign.
