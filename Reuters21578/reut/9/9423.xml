<TITLE>UAL &lt;UAL&gt; SAID TRUMP TALKED WITH UAL CHAIRMAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Real estate magnate Donald Trump told
UAL Inc Chairman Richard Ferris that he was interested in UAL
stock as an investment, according to a UAL executive.
    Trump, who was unavailable for comment, is believed by
market sources to have a sizeable position in UAL, which he
began accumulating several weeks ago. UAL stock today was up
three at 63 in active trading.
    "They (ferris and Trump) talked last week. Apparently,
Trump said he was interested in it as an investment. He didn't
say how much stock he had. He didn't say what he would or
wouldn't do about it," said UAL senior vice president Kurt
Stocker.
    Trump is believed to have close to five pct of UAL's stock,
market sources said.
