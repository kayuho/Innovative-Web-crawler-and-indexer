<TITLE>JAPAN'S 1986/87 SUGAR CANE OUTPUT SEEN FALLING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>An Agriculture Ministry survey has
estimated the nation's 1986/87 crop sugar cane output at 2.14
mln tonnes, down from 2.62 mln a year earlier.
    Ministry officials said the decline was due to bad weather
and a reduction in the land under sugar cane this season, which
totals 34,800 hectares, down from 35,700 in 1985/86, they said.
    Harvesting stretches from December 1986 to April 1987
    Japan's final output will be announced at the beginning of
June, they said.
