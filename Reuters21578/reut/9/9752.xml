<TITLE>TAIWAN'S SAVINGS AT RECORD HIGH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan has over one trillion Taiwan dlrs
in savings, official statistics show.
    Figures released yesterday show all forms of savings by
individuals and public and private firms, including bank
deposits, certificates of deposits and bond's, are running at
about 37 pct of gross national product (GNP).
    GNP rose by 14.35 pct in 1986 to 2.74 trillion dlrs.
    Taiwan's strict foreign exchange controls and lack of
incentives to invest abroad mean its huge export earnings are
mainly deposited in bank savings accounts, earning below four
pct interest each year.
