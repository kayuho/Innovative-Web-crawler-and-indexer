<TITLE>VOLCKER CALLS DOLLAR SLIDE ENOUGH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker said that the dollar's slide in currency markets has
been enough, a Fed spokesman said.
    The spokesman confirmed that Volcker, who spoke to a group
of financial analysts, said in answer to a question about the
dollar's recent slide that "enough is enough."
    Volcker has often expressed concern about the dollar
falling too rapidly in currency markets.
