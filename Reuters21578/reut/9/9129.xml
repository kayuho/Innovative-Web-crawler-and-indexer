<TITLE>JAPAN INTERVENING TO KEEP DOLLAR UP, BROKERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Mar 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan is continuing to
intervene in the Tokyo market, buying small amounts of dollars
to hold the unit above 149 yen, brokers said.
    They said the Bank is coming in when the dollar is around
149.05/10 yen, the same levels as New York's close yesterday
and the midday close in Tokyo today.
    Dealers said the Bank of Japan is intervening in the market
through both banks and brokers this afternoon.
    The central bank is checking selling orders through banks
and placing matching buy orders, they said.
    The central bank started to intervene shortly after the
market opened here in the afternoon, the dealers said.
