<TITLE>FRENCH STOCK BILL TO BE PRESENTED BEFORE JUNE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The French government will present to
parliament a major bill within two months to overhaul the Paris
stock market, economics and finance minister Edouard Balladur
said.
    Balladur told an Economist conference that on the product
side, a series of new contracts, including share options and
forward contracts in European Currency Units (ECUs), would be
introduced shortly for trading on the Paris bourse.
    The scope of the new bill, however, was to transform the
organisation of equity trading, allowing participants both to
perform a banking role and to trade in equities, he said.
