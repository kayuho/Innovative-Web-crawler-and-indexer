<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>A group led by New York investor
Asher Edelman said Morse Shoe Inc agreed to provide it
confidential company information and that his group would make
an offer to buy Morse only in a friendly, negotiated deal.
    The group also said in a filing with the Securities and

approval, buy or offer to buy any company securities giving the
group a 10 pct or more stake in the company.
