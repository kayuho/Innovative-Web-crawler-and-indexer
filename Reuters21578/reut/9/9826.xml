<TITLE>BRANIFF &lt;BAIR&gt; MAY GET MEXICAN SERVICE AUTHORITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DALLAS, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Braniff Inc said a U.S. Department of
Transportation administrative law judge has recommended that a
certificate be granted authorizing Braniff to operate air
service for five years on a temporary and experimental basis
between Dallas/Fort Worth and San Antonio, Texas, and Mexico
City and Acapulco, Mexico.
    The company said the recommendation must still be approved
by Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole and President
Reagan. Braniff has been operating the routes under exemption
authority granted by the Transportation Department in October.
