<TITLE>USACAFES &lt;USF&gt; UNIT POSTS RECORD WEEKLY SALES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DALLAS, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>USACafes LP said sales at its Bonanza
Restaurant unit rose 16.6 pct to a record 10.4 mln dlrs for the
week ended March 22.
    That compares with sales of 8,909,000 dlrs for the
comparable week last year, the partnership said.
    USACafes, which said year-to-date sales from the Bonanza
chain were up 13 pct, attributed the increase to the budget
steakhouse chain's decision to add chicken, seafood and salad
entrees to its menu.
    It said the new entrees now account for two-thirds of the
chain's sales.
