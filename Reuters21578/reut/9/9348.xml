<TITLE>IRAN SAYS HAS BETTER WEAPONS THAN SILKWORM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein
Mousavi said Iran had "more effective" missiles at its disposal
than the shore-to-sea missiles which had provoked U.S. Concern,
Tehran Radio reported.
    A U.S. State Department spokesman said last week Iran had
acquired Chinese-made Silkworm missiles which posed a greater
threat to shipping in the Gulf than the weapons previously
used.
    Tehran Radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp,
quoted Mousavi as saying that Tehran officially announced after
its forces overran southern Iraq's Faw peninsula in February
last year that it had shore-to-sea missiles.
    "The fact that the Americans, after so much delay, are now
thinking of expressing their concern with panic is because
Reagan needs this sensation now," said Mousavi, speaking after a
cabinet meeting in Tehran.
    "We also announce today that these missiles are not the
limit of our war capabilities in the Gulf," he added.
    Mousavi said the security of the Gulf region had nothing to
do with the U.S. But Iran would resort to any action to defend
the Gulf, "even those actions which are not thought probable by
Westerners."
