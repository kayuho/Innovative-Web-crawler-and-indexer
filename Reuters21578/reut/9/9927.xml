<TITLE>FRUEHAUF POSTS 20.3 MLN DLR 1986 LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fruehauf Corp, which went private in
December through a leveraged buyout, said the predecessor
company had a 1986 loss of 60.9 mln dlrs compared to earnings
of 70.5 mln dlrs in 1985.
    Sales of the predecessor company were 2.68 billion dlrs
compared to 2.56 billion dlrs in 1985, including the sales by
the operations which are divestiture candidates.
    Fruehauf said in connection with the buyout acquisition,
the predecessor company incurred about 97 mln dlrs in expenses
charged against 1986 operations.
    In addition to the direct expenses, Fruehauf said operating
results were adversely affected by an unquantifiable amount due
to the disruption related to a proxy contest and attempted
hostile takeover which started in early 1986.
    Fruehauf said its board rescheduled the annual meeting to
June 18 from May 7 to allow for completion and distribution of
the 1986 results to shareholders.
