<TITLE>NORMAL WORK RESUMES AT NEW ZEALAND PORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Normal work has resumed at New
Zealand ports as negotiations between harbour board workers and
employers continue.
    Wellington Harbour Board Workers' Union secretary Ross
Wilson told reporters talks late yesterday ended with agreement
to take unresolved issues before an industrial conciliator.
    Wilson said the only remaining issue is the length of the
union award. The dispute originally was about wage rates and
the form of industry negotiations.
    Cook Strait ferry sailings resumed after Marlborough
Harbour Board workers returned to work this morning, ending
their industrial action a day early.
    The Waterside Workers' Federation, which struck for most of
last week and held more than one mln tonnes of shipping in
ports, meets on Monday and Tuesday in conciliation with the
Waterfront Employers' Association.
    Union Secretary Sam Jennings said: "We've got two days of
talks. If it's not all cleaned up by then ... I don't know what
will happen."
