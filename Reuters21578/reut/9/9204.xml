<TITLE>CIBA-GEIGY, PHILLIPS PETROLEUM IN JOINT VENTURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BASLE, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ciba-Geigy AG &lt;CIGZ.Z&gt; said it would
establish a joint venture with Phillips Petroleum Co. In Europe
to manufacture a high performance engineering thermoplastic.
    Initially, the Swiss chemicals firm will manufacture
polyphenylene sulfide compounds using resins from Phillips.
    The two firms will later set up a joint venture to produce
the polyphenylene resins and compounds, which will be marketed
independently under their respective trademarks. A Ciba-Geigy
spokesman declined to say how much the venture would cost.
    Polyphenylene sulfide is widely used in the electronic,
automotive, and petroleum fields.
