<TITLE>BRAZIL SEAMEN SAY STRIKE NEAR END</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>About half of Brazil's 40,000 seamen
have returned to work after accords with 22 companies, and the
national strike which began on February 27 looks close to
ending, a union spokesman said.
    The spokesman, speaking from strike headquarters in Rio de
Janeiro, estimated that 80 ships were strike-bound.
    The seamen have settled for 120 pct pay increases with the
individual companies but are still discussing the issue of
overtime payments with the shipowners' association, Syndarma.
