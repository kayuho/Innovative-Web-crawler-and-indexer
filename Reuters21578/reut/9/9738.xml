<TITLE>INDIAN PLANT SIGNS FIRST ALUMINA EXPORT CONTRACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW DELHI, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>An unnamed Norwegian firm agreed to
buy 100,000 tonnes of alumina a year from a refinery in eastern
Orissa state due to start operations in the next 12 months, a
Commerce Ministry official told Reuters.
    He said the state-owned National Aluminium Co, which owns
the plant, and the state-owned Mineral and Metals Trading Corp
signed its first long-term export agreement with the company,
but gave no further details.
