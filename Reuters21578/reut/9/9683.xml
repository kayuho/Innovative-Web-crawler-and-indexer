<TITLE>SARNEY REITERATES THAT BRAZIL WILL NOT GO TO IMF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRASILIA, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Jose Sarney rejected calls
from foreign creditors and from some Brazilian businessmen that
the government talk to the International Monetary Fund.
    In a speech to about 3,000 mayors and local officials,
Sarney reiterated that the government would not accept any
monitoring of its economy by the IMF.
    He said, "We are going to struggle with courage for Brazil
and its growth. For this reason I have said that Brazil will
accept no monitoring by the IMF."
    In highly-publicized talks with Sarney near Sao Paulo last
Saturday, several Brazilian business leaders said they favoured
a return to the IMF, arguing that it would make debt
negotiations easier and bring new money into the country.
