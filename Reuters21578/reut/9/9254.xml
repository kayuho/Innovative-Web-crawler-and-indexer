<TITLE>CHINA TO TIGHTEN IMPORT CONTROL, CUT EXPORT COST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>China should tighten imports of ordinary
goods and restrict or even forbid import of goods which can be
made domestically, Premier Zhao Ziyang said.
    He told the National People's Congress, China's parliament,
that the country's foreign exchange is limited and must be used
where it is most needed. "We should expand production of import
substitutes and increase their proportion," he said. On exports,
China should increase its proportion of manufactured goods,
especially textiles, light industrial goods, electronics and
machinery, he said.
    Zhao said China should lower the cost of exports and
control the export of goods that incur too much loss.
    Zhao said China should work to provide a more favourable
investment environment for foreign businessmen.
