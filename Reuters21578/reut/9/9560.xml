<TITLE>SNC GROUP EXPECTS HIGHER 1987 EARNINGS, SALES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;SNC Group Inc&gt; expects 1987 earnings
to rise to 1.20-1.40 dlrs a share from 91 cts a share last
year, with revenues climbing to about 430 mln dlrs from last
year's 350 mln dlrs, president Alex Taylor said before the
annual meeting.
    SNC, Canada's second biggest engineering and construction
group, became the country's largest ammunition manufacturer
last year with its 90 mln dlr acquisition of Canadian Arsenals
Ltd from the Canadian government.
    The impact of that and several smaller deals will be felt
fully in 1987, Taylor said.
    Defense preoducts and other manufacturing operations will
account for more than half SNC's total 1987 revenues, helping
to counterbalance the more cyclical engineering and
construction acivities, Taylor said.
    Last year, SNC earned 8.7 mln dlrs, including a small
extraordinary gain.
    In 1987, a total manufacturing activities will generate
about 235 mln dlrs in revenues, and engineering and
construction about 200 mln dlrs, he said, adding that defense
products operations should be a major contributor to earnings.
