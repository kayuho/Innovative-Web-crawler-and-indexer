<TITLE>DAUSTER SAYS NO CHANGE IN BRAZIL'S COFFEE POLICY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, MARCH 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil will not announce any
changes to its coffee export policy, Brazilian Coffee Institute
(IBC) president Jorio Dauster said.
    He told Reuters Brazil was not planning to modify the
position it held before the recent International Coffee
Organisation meeting.
    Earlier this month, talks in London to set new ICO export
quotas failed.
    Commenting on the outcome of a coffee producers' meeting in
Managua last weekend, Dauster said that they discussed nothing
involving the market.
    "In the meeting we agreed to work on behalf of the union of
the producers in matters related to an international agreement,"
Dauster said.
    The Managua meeting was attended by representatives from
Brazil, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica,
Nicaragua and Panama, the latter represented at the meeting
merely as an observer.
