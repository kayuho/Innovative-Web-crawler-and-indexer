<TITLE>SMITH BARNEY ANALYST CUTS HERCULES &lt;HPC&gt; RATING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co
analyst James Wilbur removed Hercules Inc from the firm's
recommended list, citing the firm's moves into the aerospace
business, traders said.
    Hercules fell 2-1/4 to 59-1/4 on 595,000 shares. Wilbur was
not immediately available for comment.
    Sources said Wilbur believes Hercules will be successful in
its diversification, but he told clients the stock market is
more receptive now to chemical companies than aerospace
companies.
