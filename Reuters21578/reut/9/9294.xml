<TITLE>MARCH PRICES FELL IN GERMAN STATE ON YEAR-AGO</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DUESSELDORF, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The cost of living in North
Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, fell 0.1 pct
in the month to mid-March to stand 0.5 pct lower than at the
same time a year earlier, the regional statistics office said.
    Prices had risen 0.3 pct in the month to mid-February but
had fallen 0.7 pct year-on-year.
    The regional figures are considered a good guide to
national inflation trends. The Federal Statistics Office is due
to publish provisional national figures for March by the end of
this month.
