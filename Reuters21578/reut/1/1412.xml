<TITLE>C.T.C. DEALER EXTENDS BID FOR CANADIAN TIRE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>C.T.C. Dealer Holdings Ltd said it
extended its previously announced offer for 49 pct of &lt;Canadian
Tire Corp Ltd&gt; to midnight on March 26.
    CTC, a group of Canadian Tire dealers, which already owns
17 pct of Canadian Tire, is currently appealing in an Ontario
court against a previously announced Ontario Securities
Commission ruling blocking CTC's 272 mln dlr bid.
    The blocked bid did not include non-voting shareholders,
who hold 96 pct of Canadian Tire equity.
