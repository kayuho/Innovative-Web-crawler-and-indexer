<TITLE>KLM LOWERS TRANSATLANTIC FARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>KLM Royal Dutch Airlines &lt;KLM.AS&gt;, in
a move following similar steps recently by U.S. carrier TWA,
said it is cutting its fares on transatlantic flights from
April 1.
    From April 1, a return fare Amsterdam-New York will be cut
by eight per cent to 1,099 guilders for the low season until
mid-June, when seasonal increases will come into effect.
    KLM recently rejected invitations by TWA to coordinate
price cuts on the Amsterdam route and a spokesman said KLM had
only moved now to start up a nationwide promotional campaign in
the Netherlands to boost travel to the U.S.
