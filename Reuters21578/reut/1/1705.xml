<TITLE>ANALYST REITERATES BUY ON SOME DRUG STOCKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Merrill Lynch and Co analyst Richard
Vietor said he reiterated a buy recommendation on several drug
stocks today.
    The stocks were Bristol-Myers Co &lt;BMY&gt;, which rose 2-1/4 to
101, Schering-Plough Corp &lt;SGP&gt; 2-7/8 to 97 and Syntex Corp
&lt;SYN&gt; 1-3/8 to 82. Vietor described these stocks as a "middle
group" of performers.
    Vietor said the prices of these stocks, "look pretty cheap
relative to the leading performers in the drug group, such as
Upjohn Co &lt;UPJ&gt;, Merck and Co Inc &lt;MRK&gt;, and Squibb Corp
&lt;SQB&gt;."
    Vietor said he also mentioned Pfizer Inc &lt;PFE&gt; up two to
72-3/4 and Warner-Lambert Co &lt;WLA&gt; up 1-1/2 to 74-1/2 as being
in the middle group. But he did not recommend those stocks,
which he rates as neutral.
