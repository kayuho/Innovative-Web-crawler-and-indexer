<TITLE>USDA PROPOSES NAME CHANGES IN BEEF GRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department
proposes to rename the "USDA Good" grade of beef to "USDA Select."
    The department said the proposed change is in response to a
petition from Public Voice for Food and Health Policy and would
present a more positive image of this grade of beef and help
calorie-conscious consumers select leaner cuts of meat.
    Under current rules, the "good" grade of meat has less
marbling and fat than the "prime" or "choice" grades, it said.
    Standards for all of the grades would remain unchanged
under the proposal.
