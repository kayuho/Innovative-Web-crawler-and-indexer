<TITLE>CARLING O'KEEFE &lt;CKB&gt; TO RETAIN FOOTBALL CLUB</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Carling O'Keefe Ltd said the board
decided to retain ownership of its Toronto Argonaut Football
Club, after considering offers to acquire the team.
    The company said it received a number of expressions of
interest in buying the club, of which two became formal offers
to purchase.
    Neither offer met the company's unspecified requirements
for selling the football club, Carling said.
    The Toronto Argonauts are a member of the Canadian Football
League.
