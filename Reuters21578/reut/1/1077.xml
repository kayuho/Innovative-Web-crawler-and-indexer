<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Three black workers were killed and
seven injured in fighting at a South African zinc refinery last
night, Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd said.
    The company said two groups of workers began attacking each
other at about 1000 local time with machetes, knives and sticks
at a hostel at the Zincor plant, some 40 kms east of
Johannesburg.
    It said the fighting was "quelled" after 25 minutes by its
own security staff. Police were called but the fighting had
ended by the time they arrived.
    A company spokesman said he had no idea of the cause of the
fighting. An investigation was underway, he said.
