CORRECTED - GM SEES
    Fry said at an average price of 13,000 dollars, his
projected sales figure for North American-made GM cars in
Europe would mean turnover of between 91 million and 104
million dollars.
    GM sales in Europe of North American-made cars in the 1985
model year totalled 500 vehicles, due largely to uncompetitive
prices because of the then strong dollar, Fry said.
    The North American-made GM vehicles sold in Europe are
manufactured in the United States and Canada, he said, with
most sales in Switzerland followed by Sweden and West Germany.
    -- inserting dropped words to make clear story refers only
to North American-made GM cars.
