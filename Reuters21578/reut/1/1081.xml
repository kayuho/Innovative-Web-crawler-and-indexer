<TITLE>GM &lt;GM&gt; HOPES FOR FIVE-FOLD RISE IN EUROPEAN SALES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Carmaker General Motors hopes to
sell between 7,000 and 8,000 vehicles in Europe this year, a
five-fold rise over the year before, James Fry, vice-president
of GM Overseas Distribution Corporation told a news briefing.
    "The low dollar makes our prices very attractive," he said at
a GM preview before the opening of the Geneva Motor Show.
    "We would like to sell between 7,000 and 8,000 units in
Europe for the year to August 1987," he told Reuters later.
Officials said GM sold 1,500 vehicles in the 1986 model year.
    Fry said that at an average price of 13,000 dlrs, his
projected sales figures would mean turnover of between 91 mln
and 104 mln dlrs in Europe.
    GM sales in Europe in the 1985 model year totalled 500
vehicles, due largely to uncompetitive prices because of the
then strong dollar, Fry said.
    All GM vehicles sold in Europe are manufactured in the
United States and Canada, he said, adding that most sales were
in Switzerland followed by Sweden and West Germany.
