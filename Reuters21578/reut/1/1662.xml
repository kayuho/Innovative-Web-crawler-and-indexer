<TITLE>&lt;RANGE ROVER&gt; TO SELL VEHICLES IN U.S.</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Detroit, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Range Rover of North America Inc, a
subsidiary of the British Land Rover Group, said it would begin
selling the luxury utility vehicles in the United States March
16 at a suggested retail price of 30,825 dlrs.
    Range Rover executives told Reuters after a press
conference they expect to generate 80 mln dlrs in revenues this
year, but that the U.S. venture is not expected to become
profitable until 1989.
    The executives said they expect to sell 3,000 of the
vehicles this year from an initial network of 37 dealers, which
will be gradually expanded to 65 within a year.
    Range Rover's project, aimed at buyers with household
incomes above 100,000 dlrs annually, is the culmination of a
four-year effort by Land Rover Group to introduce the
British-build vehicle in the U.S. market.
    The executives said the only option to be offered with the
vehicles will be a leather upholstery package priced at 1,025
dlrs.
