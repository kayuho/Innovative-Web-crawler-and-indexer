<TITLE>ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER CRAXI SAYS HE WILL RESIGN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Socialist Prime Minister Bettino Craxi said
his five party coalition government would resign.
    Craxi, Italy's prime minister for a postwar record of 3-1/2
years, told the Senate (upper house) he would hand his and the
government's resignation to President Francesco Cossiga
immediately after leaving the chamber.
    Craxi has been prime minister, at the head of two separate
but identical five-party coalitions, since August 1983.
