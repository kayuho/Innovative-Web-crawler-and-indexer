<DATELINE>    DOTHAN, Ala., March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>National Healthcare Inc said it has
received a waiver until May 26 of its technical defaults under
covenants of its bank credit agreement.

agreement, its line of credit has been cut to 125 mln dlrs due

working capital, bringing the total borrowed against the line
to about 120 mln dlrs.
