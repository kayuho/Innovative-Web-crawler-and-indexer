<TITLE>JAPAN'S CHAMBER OF COMMERCE URGES FISCAL SPENDING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 -</DATELINE><BODY>President of the Japan Chamber of Commerce
and Industry (JCCI) Noboru Gotoh called on the Government to
issue additional construction bonds as an emergency measure to
stimulate domestic demand.
    Gotoh told a press conference that increased fiscal
spending is the only alternative to prop up the economy as
credit conditions are easy enough, a JCCI spokesman said.
    Japan faces serious unemployment unless more construction
bonds, to raise cash for public works, are issued but Japan
should continue to carry out fiscal reform programmes, Gotoh
said.
