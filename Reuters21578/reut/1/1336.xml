<TITLE>ALLEGHENY INT'L &lt;AG&gt; TO CLOSE THREE PLANTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PITTSBURGH, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Allegheny International Inc said it
plans to close three appliance manufacturing plants as part of
a restructuring.
    The company said it will close its Milwaukee plant by
October 1, idling 350 employees, and its Dayton, Tenn.,
facility, with about 300 employees, by March 1, 1988.
    In addition, a plant in Toronto will phase out production
of small electric appliances over the next eight month's,
affecting about 195 of the facility's 425 employees.
    Production of barbecue grills and lawn mowers is also under
review at the Toronto plant, operated by the company's Sunbeam
Corp (Canada) unit. The plant will continue selling appliances
in Canada.
    The company's Oster division makes blenders and other
appliances at the Milwaukee and Dayton plants. Oster
headquarters will stay in Milwaukee and manufacturing of
products will be consolidated at other facilities in
McMinnville and Cookville, both in Tennessee.
