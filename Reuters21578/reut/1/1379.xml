<TITLE>KANEB ENERGY &lt;KEP&gt; MAY OMIT FUTURE PAYOUTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kaneb Energy Partners Ltd said it may be
forced to omit or lower future quarterly cash distributions
because of a contract dispute with two major customers and the
continued slump in oil and gas prices.
    The partnership said, however, that it will pay a regular
quarterly distribution of 60 cts a unit on April 15 to holders
of record March 31.
