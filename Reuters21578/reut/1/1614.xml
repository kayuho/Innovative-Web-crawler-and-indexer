<TITLE>UAW TO MEET WITH PRESS ON AMERICAN MOTORS &lt;AMO&gt;</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>United Auto Workers vice president Marc
Stepp said he will meet with reporters this afternoon on the
union's negotiations with American Motors Corp.
    A union spokesman was not immediately available to discuss
the content of the press conference, set to begin at 1530 EST.
    Both the union and American Motors this week have voiced
willingness to return to the negotiating table to try to hammer
out a contract for UAW workers at the automakers' Kenosha,
Wis., facility, after talks broke down last weekend.
     An American Motors spokesman said no time or place has yet
been set to resume the talks.
