<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury secretary James Baker
predicted the U.S. trade deficit would decline 15-20 billion
dlrs this year.
    However, he acknowledged signs were still lacking on such a
decline.

    "It has begun to level off (but) we don't see it beginning
to go down yet," he told the panel.
