<TITLE>CRIBB NAMED REAGAN'S DOMESTIC AFFAIRS ADVISER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan, moving to add a
prominent conservative to his top White House management team,
named Kenneth Cribb to be his domestic affairs adviser.
    Cribb, a former counselor to Attorney General Edwin Meese,
has served on the transition team assembled by new White House
chief of staff Howard Baker since early March.
    Baker, who replaced Donald Regan as the president's top
aide, is considered a moderate Republican as is his deputy,
Kenneth Duberstein.
    Reagan also announced that Edwin Feulner, another leading
conservative activist, would serve as a consultant to the White
House. However, Feulner will remain president of the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative Washington think tank.
