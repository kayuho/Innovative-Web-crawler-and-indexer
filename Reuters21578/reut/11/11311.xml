<TITLE>METROPOLITAN LIFE SUBSIDIARY IN HOTEL PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PHOENIX, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Metropolitan Life Insurance Co of New
York's&gt; Compris Hotel Corp said it singed a letter of intent to
develop 33 Compri hotels by 1991.
    The hotels are to be built in the U.S. and Canada, the
company said. Compris said it signed the pact with Accor North
American Corp, a wholly-owned subsidiary of &lt;Accor S.A.&gt;, a
Paris-based firm.
    In the U.S., Accor will primarily develop Compri hotels on
the East Coast, with specific emphasis on the Tri-State area of
New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, Compris said.
    Accor will gain licensing rights to Canada, Compris said.
