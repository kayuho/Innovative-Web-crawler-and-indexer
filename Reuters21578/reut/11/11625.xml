<DATELINE>    MIDLAND, Mich., March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dow Chemical Co's Thermoplastic
Resin Department said it is amending a recent price increase
for Magnum ABS (A) resins announced March 3 for an effective
date of April 1.
    Dow said that effective April 15 the selling prices for
most grades of Magnum ABS resins for the injection molding,
custom sheet and automotive markets will rise six cts a pound,
instead of the three cts a pound announced previously.
