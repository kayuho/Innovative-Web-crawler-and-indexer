<TITLE>SIEMENS WINS DANISH TELEPHONE SWITCHING ORDER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MUNICH, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Siemens AG &lt;SIEG.F&gt; said it won a major
order from Jydisk Telfon Aktieselskab (JTAG), Denmark's second
largest telephone company, for its EWSD digital dialing system.
    A Siemens statement gave no financial details. But it said
the JTAG order, together with an order received in 1985 from
the largest Danish telephone firm, Kjobenhavn Telefon
Aktieselskab (KTAS), brought Siemens' order volume in Denmark
to around 100 mln marks over the next 10 years.
    The JTAG order is for at least 125,000 telephone
connections with an option to double this amount later.
    Siemens said the order meant that it, like Sweden's L.M.
Ericsson &lt;ERIC.ST&gt;, now supply both of Denmark's largest
telephone companies.
    Together Siemens and Ericsson have 90 pct of the Danish
long-distance dialing system market, it added.
