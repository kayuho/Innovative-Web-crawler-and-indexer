<TITLE>THAILAND BUYS YUGOSLAV CRANES IN BARTER DEAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Cabinet approved a plan for the
Port Authority of Thailand to buy six gantry cranes from
Metalna Co of Yugoslavia for about 13.4 mln dlrs, a government
spokesman said.
    He said Thailand will pay for 25 pct of the cost of the
cranes in U.S. Dlrs and the rest by sales of rice, textiles and
other commodities to Yugoslavia.
    The Bangkok Shipowners and Agents Association has appealed
to the government to scrap the purchase plan. It said it would
be an unnecessary expense as most vessels calling at the port
already have their own cargo handling equipment.
