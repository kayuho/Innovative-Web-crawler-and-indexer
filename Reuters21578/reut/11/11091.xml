<TITLE>TEXAS WEEKLY CROP REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AUSTIN, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Texas weekly USDA state crop report
said stormy winter weather limited fieldwork before conditions
improved later in the week.
    A snowstorm caused some cattle deaths in the Panhandle, and
cold, wet weather covered many areas. Windy weather followed to
dry fields and limit planting delays.
    Small grains made good progress despite cool temperatures
which slowed growth. Additional moisture was needed in some
areas. Many fields were booting and some were beginning to
head. Wheat was rated 16 pct fair, 56 pct good and 28 pct
excellent.
    Corn and sorghum planting progressed, and land preparation
was ahead of schedule in the Plains despite snowy weather.
Cotton planting progressed in the Lower Valley.
