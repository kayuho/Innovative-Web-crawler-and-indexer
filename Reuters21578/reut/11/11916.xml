<DATELINE>    CINCINNATI, Ohio, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taft Broadcasting Co said the

Group, which had been set for yesterday, did not occur.
    TVX and its investment bankers, Salomon Inc's &lt;SB&gt; Salomon
Brothers, advised Taft the closing would not be consumated as
scheduled, the company said.
    TVX and Salomon also advised Taft they hope to be able to
close in near future, the company said, adding it is prepared

after tax charge of 45 to 50 mln dlrs.
