<TITLE>AUDIO/VIDEO &lt;AVA&gt; TO GET EXPENSES FROM DIXONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DAYTON, Ohio, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Audio/Video Affiliates Inc said it
will receive an undisclosed amount from &lt;Dixons Group PLC&gt; in
connection with the termination of Cyacq Corp's 92.50 dlr per
share tender offer for Cyclops Corp &lt;CYL&gt;.
    The company said the amount from Dixons is in lieu of
reimbursement expenses for the Cyacq tender.  Citicorp &lt;CCI&gt;
was the other partner in Cyacq.
    The payment was in connection with Dixons' previously
-announced agreement to increase its tender price for Cyclops
to 95.00 dlrs per share, Cycacq's ending of its competing bid
and the ending of litigation between the parties.
