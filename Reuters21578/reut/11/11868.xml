<TITLE>EIGHT CALABRIAN BANK OFFICIALS RELEASED FROM JAIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    REGGIO CALABRIA, Italy, April l - </DATELINE><BODY>Eight banking officials
arrested on embezzlement charges nine days ago have been
released from jail on provisional liberty, pending a hearing of
charges in court, judicial sources said.
    The president, vice-president, former president,
director-general and four other managers at the southern
Italian &lt;Cassa di Risparmio di Calabria e Lucania - Carical&gt;
had been released but were still under investigation for an
alleged embezzlement conspiracy. Three other bank officials are
still being held in custody.
    Those released include former Carical president Francesco
Del Monte, who was vice-president of one of Italy's largest
state banks &lt;BNL - Banca Nazionale del Lavoro&gt; at the time of
his arrest. BNL said last week it had appointed another member
of the board to take on the role of vice-president temporarily.
    The arrests followed the appointment by the Bank of Italy
of three commissioners to run Carical temporarily following
investigations revealing serious irregularities at the bank.
    Police sources say the embezzlement charges relate to loans
given by the bank to the southern Italian-based food processing
firm Jonicagrumi.
