<DATELINE>    RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Electric
Co said the U.S. Defense Electronics Supply Center has awarded
its Research Triangle Park, N.C., facility a generic
certification for the production of two-micro gate arrays for
military use.
    The company said after it qualifies three generic test
circuits using the newly-certified two-micro process -- a
standard evaluation chip, micro test chip and JEDEC benchmark
chip -- the facility will require greatly simplified testing to
comply with military standards.  That qualification is expected
by the fourth quarter, the company said.
