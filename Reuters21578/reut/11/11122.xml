<TITLE>ANGLO CHIEF URGES S.AFRICA REPEAL DISCRIMINATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Anglo American Gold Investment Co
chairman Julian Thompson urged the South African government to
repeal legislation preventing black advancement in the mining
industry.
    Thompson, commenting in the annual report, said the mining
industry remained "cynical" about whether Pretoria really intends
to remove barriers which prevent blacks from holding skilled
jobs.
    He urged the government to back up pledges by introducing a
bill when parliament reconvenes later this year.
    The vast majority of South Africa's 600,000 miners are
black but whites perform most supervisory jobs.
    The government has vowed to open all mining jobs to all
races this year but the mining industry fears clauses inserted
in an abolition bill could be used to make it difficult for
blacks to qualify for skilled positions.
    "The reluctance of the government to repeal (discriminatory
provisions) obstructs the advancement of blacks and denies them
opportunities for taking increasing responsibilities," Thompson
said.
