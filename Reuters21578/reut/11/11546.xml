<TITLE>WHITE HOUSE WELCOMES RISE IN INDICATORS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The White House welcomed last
month's 0.7 pct increase in the Index of Leading Economic
Indicators, the government's key barometer of future economic
growth.
    The increase reversed a decline in January of 0.5 pct.
    Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the new
figures signalling more economic growth in coming months showed
that the index was "back on track" after its downturn at the
first of the year.
