<TITLE>LINEAR &lt;LNER&gt; SEES LOWER COMPARABLE 4TH QTR NET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TULSA, Okla., April 1,  - </DATELINE><BODY>Linear Films Inc said its fourth
quarter earnings for the period ended March 31, will be lower
than the 1,235,000 dlrs or 19 cts a share reported in the
year-ago quarter on sales of 11.8 mln dlrs.
    The company attributed the lower earnings to narrowing
profit margins on stretch film.

by six pct effective April 15.
