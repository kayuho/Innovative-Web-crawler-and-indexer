<DATELINE>     SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Energy futures now set the
standard for oil pricing, said Arnold Safer, president of The
Energy Futures Group Inc, a consulting firm.

said, adding that some oil products sellers now offer contracts
based on a daily average of NYMEX prices.

oil companies as well as for commodity traders. His remarks
