<TITLE>TREASURY'S BAKER SEES REAGAN OPPOSING OIL TAX</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker told
the House Appropriations Committee that he believes the
president remains opposed to an oil import fee.
    He said Reagan last year rejected the idea and he added:
    "In my personal view he is not likely to change his thinking
on that."
    He said Reagan last year opposed the idea because the
energy industry was divided on the issue, a tax would require a
new bureacracy to administer and the resulting higher energy
prices would harm U.S. competitiveness.
