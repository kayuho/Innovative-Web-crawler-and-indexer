<TITLE>BANNER &lt;BNR&gt; DISPUTE MUST GO TO ARBITRATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CLEVELAND, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Banner Industries Inc said a judge of
the U.S. District Court in Chicago ruled that Banner must
resolve its pension fund dispute in arbitration rather than in
federal court.
    The court's ruling stems from a lawsuit Banner filed in
federal court last May seeking a ruling that it is not liable
to the Central States Fund for about 20 mln dlrs in pension
withdrawal liability payments.
    Banner said the district court reserved ruling on whether
it must pay about five mln dlrs that the Central Fund claims is
owed in back-due interim payments.
