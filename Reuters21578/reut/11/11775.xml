<TITLE>MALAYSIA CUTS GAZETTED RUBBER PRICE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Malaysia said it cut the gazetted
price of rubber to 202-7/8 cents per kg from 213-1/2 cents in
March, effective immediately.
    No export duty is applicable at this level, against 3/8
cent per kg last month, because the government raised the
export duty threshold price to 210 cents per kg in early 1985.
    The cess for rubber research and replanting remained
unchanged at 3.85 and 9.92 cents per kg respectively.
