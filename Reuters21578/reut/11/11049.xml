<TITLE>METROMAIL &lt;MTMA&gt; PREDICTS FLAT EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LINCOLN, Neb., March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Metromail Corp said it expects
flat operating profits for its 1987 fiscal year ending May 31
with last fiscal year's earnings from operations of 9,943,000
dlrs, or 1.05 dlrs a share.
    The company said the flat results will be due to higher
than normal expenditures during the fourth quarter for
expansion of its data processing capabilities.
    Earlier, Metromail reported fiscal 1987 third quarter
earnings of 2.4 mln dlrs, or 25 cts a share, versus three mln
dlrs, or 32 cts a share, the prior third quarter, and nine
months net of 7.2 mln dlrs, or 76 cts a share, versus 7.8 mln
dlrs, or 82 cts a share the prior nine months.
