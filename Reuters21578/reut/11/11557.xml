<TITLE>ROYAL DUTCH/SHELL &lt;RD&gt; SPECIAL MEETING REQUESTED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Royal Dutch/Shell said two groups of
U.S. investors have requested a special shareholders meeting to
discuss the company's presence in South Africa.
    But it said that a special meeting could only be held under
Dutch law if 10 pct of its shareholders agree.
    Two groups of U.S. investors, it said, have less than one
pct of the outstanding shares in the company.
    The groups are seeking a special meeting to call for an end
to sales to the South African police and military, and
withdrawal from South Africa, it said.
    Royal Dutch spokesman Eric Steneker told Reuters
shareholders were entitled to discuss any matter relating to
Shell at May's annual general meeting. "In fact, Shell in South
Africa has been discussed at every meeting of shareholders for
more than 10 years," Steneker said.
    Representatives of American Baptist Churches and the New
York City Teachers Retirement System said Shell refused to
discuss their proposals at the next meeting.
    Steneker said investors had ample opportunity to express 
views and a majority supported the board's view that it should
stay in South Africa to act as a force for change.
