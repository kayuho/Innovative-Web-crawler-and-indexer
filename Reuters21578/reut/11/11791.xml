<TITLE>COURT BLOCKS DELTA-WESTERN AIRLINES MERGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN FRANCISCO, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>A U.S. Appeals court last night
blocked the 860 mln dlr merger of Delta Airlines Inc &lt;DAL.N&gt;
and &lt;Western Airlines&gt; just hours before it was to go into
effect because of a dispute over union representation.
    The ruling came in a lawsuit in which the Air Transport
Employees union said Western's management should fulfil a
promise to honour union contracts if a merger took place.
    The airlines argued that Western's promise could not be
enforced in a takeover by a larger company. Airlines officials
could not be reached for comment on the ruling, which halts the
merger until arbitration on the dispute is completed.
