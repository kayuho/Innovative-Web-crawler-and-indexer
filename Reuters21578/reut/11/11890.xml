<TITLE>BRAZILIAN BANK STRIKE STARTS TO CRUMBLE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>An eight-day-old national bank strike
started to crumble following a warning from the federally-owned
Banco do Brasil that it could dismiss employees who did not
return to work, a union spokesman said.
    Banco do Brasil's staff in several major cities, including
Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba, had decided to return to
work. Probably about half of the country's bank staff would be
working, he added.
