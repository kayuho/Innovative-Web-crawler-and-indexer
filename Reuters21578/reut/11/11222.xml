<TITLE>THATCHER SAYS TRADE TARGETS SET WITH MOSCOW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
said she and Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov had set targets for
increased trade between the two countries during talks earlier
today.
    She said she hoped more economic exchanges between Britain
and the Soviet Union "will also lead to increased friendship and
increased understanding."
    Earlier, she told a meeting of Soviet and British
businessmen that she had agreed with Ryzhkov that they would
work to achieve a total volume of 2.5 billion roubles in
bilateral trade by 1990.
    This would entail an increase by each side of 350 to 400
mln stg over their present export levels.
    "Mr Ryzhkov handed me a list of import and export
opportunities which I hope you will all jump at," she told the
meeting to mark the opening of new offices of the British-
Soviet Chamber of Commerce.
    After her talks with Ryzhkov, Thatcher and the Soviet
Premier were joined for the signing of agreements covering new
scientific and cultural exchanges by Kremlin leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, who had nine hours of talks with her yesterday.
