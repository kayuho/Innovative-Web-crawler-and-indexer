<TITLE>NEWMONT MINING &lt;NEM&gt; SETS HIGHER SPENDING IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Newmont Mining Corp estimates its 1987

year end from 5,250,376 shares a year earlier.
    Newmont's annual report said the company held 2.5 pct of Du
Pont's stock at the end of 1986, up from 2.2 pct a year
earlier.
    The report also said Newmont's proven oil reserves declined
to 7,970,000 barrels at the end of 1986 from 8,530,000 barrels
a year earlier and its natural gas reserves declined to 271.48
billion cubic feet from 274.82 billion at the end of 1985.
