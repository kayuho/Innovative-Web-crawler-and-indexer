<TITLE>ROCKY MOUNT &lt;RMUC&gt; EXPECTS PROFIT IN FIRST QTR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROCKY MOUNT, N.C., March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hal Weiss, chairman,
president and chief executive officer, of Rocky Mount
Undergarment Co Inc, said he expects the company to show a
profit for the first quarter fiscal 1987.
    Weiss said sales for 1987 have been strong following a net
loss of 1,548,000 dlrs, or 53 cts a share, for the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1986. The company reported a net loss for the
year of 2,408,000 dlrs, or 82 cts a share.
    Rocky Mount recorded net income of 248,000 dlrs, or eight
cts per share, for the first quarter of fiscal 1986.
    Weiss attributed the poor year to problems involving
management, manufacturing operations, financial condition and
credibility among its suppliers.
    Weiss predicted the pattern of quarterly lossses which
characterized 1986 will be reversed and 1987 will see the
company return to profitability.
