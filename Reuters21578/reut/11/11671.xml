<TITLE>U.S. CREDITS FOR ECUADOR SWITCHED TO VEG OIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Commodity Credit Corporation
(CCC) switched five mln dlrs in credit guarantees to Ecuador to
provide for more sales of U.S. vegetable oil, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    The credit guarantees were previously earmarked for sales
of U.S. cotton, feedgrains and wheat.
    The action reduces the guarantee lines previously
authorized for sales of cotton from 1.5 mln dlrs to 500,000
dlrs, for feedgrains from four mln to two mln and for wheat
from 45 mln dlrs to 43 mln dlrs and increases coverage for
vegetable oil sales from two mln to seven mln dlrs, the
department said.
