<TITLE>HAWKE DECIDES AGAINST EARLY AUSTRALIAN ELECTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Bob Hawke has decided
against an early election despite a leadership crisis in the
opposition coalition, Australian government officials said.
    They said Hawke made the decision after meeting senior
advisers and high-ranking members of the ruling Labour Party in
Canberra last night.
    An expected improvement in the economy predicted by an
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report
was a major factor in Hawke's deciding against calling an
election now, they said.
    The officials picked March 5 next year as the most likely
election date, which would allow the government to complete its
full five-year term of office and ensure that Hawke becomes the
longest-serving Labour Prime Minister in Australian history.
    Hawke, however, has not withdrawn his earlier threat to
consider dissolving both houses of parliament if the opposition
National-Liberal Party coalition blocked legislation to
introduce identity cards for Australians.
