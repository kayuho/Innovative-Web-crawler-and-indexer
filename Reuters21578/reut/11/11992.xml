<TITLE>HOWARD BAKER AIDE EXPECTED TO GET TOP JOB</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The White House is expected today to
name Thomas Griscom, a longtime aide to chief of staff Howard
Baker, as President Reagan's communications director.
    Officials said an announcement was expected to be made
during Reagan's trip to Philadelphia where the president is to
make a speech to a group of doctors on the deadly disease AIDS
(Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).
    Griscom, 37, was brought into the White House by former
Senator Baker to help with the transition after Baker was named
chief of staff following the resignation of Donald Regan in the
wake of the Iran arms scandal.
    He will take the job vacated by Patrick Buchanan, a
high-profile conservative, who served two years as
communications director.
