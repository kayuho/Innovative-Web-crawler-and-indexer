<TITLE>MIDAM EXCHANGE MOVES TO CBT FLOOR, EXPANDS HOURS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>The MidAmerica Commodity Exchange
(MIDAM) moved from the former Chicago Mercantile Exchange floor
to a room off the main trading floors of the Chicago Board of
Trade (CBT) today and expanded trading hours for Treasury-bond
futures to 0720 to 1515 CST.
    CBT bond futures continue to trade from 0800 to 1400 CST.
    The MIDAM was founded last century as the Chicago Open
Board of Trade as a grain exchange and has since expanded to
include smaller contracts of livestock, currencies, metals and
financial futures.
    MIDAM traders said the new CBT facilities worked well
today, offering more inter-market spread opportunities in two
trading pits than on the old floor which they believed was too
large for the volume of trade.
