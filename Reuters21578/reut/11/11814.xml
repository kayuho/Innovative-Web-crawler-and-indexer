<DATELINE>    PADERBORN, West Germany, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nixdorf Computer AG
&lt;NIXG.F&gt; said its supervisory board has appointed Sven Kado to
the new position of deputy member of the managing board,
increasing the number of board members to seven.
    Kado, 42, will be responsible for finance and purchasing.
Until now finance has been the responsibility of Klaus Luft,
who was named chairman of the board following the death of
company founder Heinz Nixdorf in March 1986.
    Kado, whose appointment takes effect from today, joined
Nixdorf in 1984 and was previously the company's head of
controlling and purchasing.
