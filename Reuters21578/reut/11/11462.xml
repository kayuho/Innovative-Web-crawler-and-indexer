<TITLE>CSCE ALTERS RULES ON TRADING LIMITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange
amended regulations governing expanded trading limits on
coffee, cocoa and sugar contracts to provide uniformity.
    Effective today, the exchange will permit normal daily
price limits in those commodities to expand whenever the first
two limited contract months move the limit in the same
direction for two consecutive sessions.
    The normal daily limits will be reinstated once the first
two limited deliveries close by less than the normal limit for
two successive trading days.
    Previously exchange rules required the first three limited
months to move the limit in coffee and cocoa. It had required
the first two limited sugar deliveries to make such moves for
three consecutive sessions.
