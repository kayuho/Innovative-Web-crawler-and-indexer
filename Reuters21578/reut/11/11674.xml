<TITLE>COLEMAN &lt;CLN&gt; SEES 1ST QTR CHARGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WICHITA, KAN., March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Coleman Co said it expects a
first-quarter charge against earnings of 1.6 mln dlrs, or 23
cts a share, as a result of its voluntary program to replace
condensing heat exchangers in its early Model 90 series
high-efficiency residential gas furnaces.
    The company said extensive testing indicates a problem
found in the furnaces is not safety related. Coleman said it
noted an increasing number of heat exchangers in certain
furnaces made from March 1984 through December 1985 were
returned because of corrosion.
