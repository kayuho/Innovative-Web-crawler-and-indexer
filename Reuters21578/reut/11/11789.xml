<TITLE>GERMAN 2.2 PCT GROWTH AVERAGE SEEN TO 1991</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DUESSELDORF, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The economy will grow by an average
rate of 2.2 pct a year in real terms between now and the end of
1991, Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale (WestLB) said in an
annual report.
    A year ago WestLB had forecast average growth of just under
three pct for 1986-1990.
    The 1987 report said gross national product would only
expand a real 1.7 pct this year -- below previous expectations
-- because of weaker exports. Growth rates will pick up later,
however, producing a 2.2 pct increase on average for the
five-year period.
