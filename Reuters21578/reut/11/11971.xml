<TITLE>TEXAS INSTRUMENTS &lt;TXN&gt; OPINION REAFFIRMED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Texas Instruments Inc, one of the few
U.S. semiconductor producers expected to benefit directly from
the Reagan Administration's actions to curtail Japanese dumping
of chips, received a reaffirmed buy recommendation from Smith
Barney today.
    The stock rose four points to 189.
    Traders said the recommendation by Smith Barney analyst
James Barlage, which focused on the relief the company will get
from the dumping situation and the subsequent earnings momentum
as a result of that action, helped to propel the stock higher
today.
