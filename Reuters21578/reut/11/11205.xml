<TITLE>AKZO REVISES 1986 PROFIT UP SLIGHTLY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ARNHEM, The Netherlands, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch chemicals group
Akzo NV &lt;AKZO.AS&gt; said in its annual report it had revised its
1986 net profit figure up to 842 mln guilders from a
provisional 840 mln guilders announced in January.
    The turnover figure was unchanged at 15.62 billion
guilders.
    Akzo said it would be difficult to maintain this profit
level in 1987 but it expected positive developments "in the
longer term."
    Profits in 1985 totalled 843 mln guilders on a turnover of
18.01 billion.
