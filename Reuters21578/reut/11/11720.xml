<TITLE>FDIC TO EASE RULE FOR BANKS' SECURITIES UNITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp
proposed to ease its regulations on operations of securities
subsidiaries of banks.
    The FDIC proposed for comment for 30 days amendments to end
a ban on the sharing of a corporate name and logo by a bank and
its security unit.
    It also said the securities subsidiary was no longer
required to have an entrance separate from the bank's, but the
bank's and subsidiary's separate office space must be marked.
    The bank must inform customers that securities purchased
from the subsidiary were not covered by FDIC deposit insurance.
