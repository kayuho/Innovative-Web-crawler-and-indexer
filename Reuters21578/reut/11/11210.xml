<TITLE>ADSTEAM TO ACQUIRE 49 PCT OF U.K. PROPERTY COMPANY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ADELAIDE, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd &lt;ADSA.S&gt;
(Adsteam) said it will subscribe to 30 mln shares in listed
British property developer, &lt;Markheath Securities Plc&gt;, at 60p
each, subject to shareholder approval.
    The subscription, expected to take place in May, will give
Adsteam 49 pct of Markheath, Adsteam said in a statement.

chairman of Markheath and two other Adsteam nominees will join
its board. "We hope that in time Markheath will become a

as Adsteam," Spalvins said in the statement.
