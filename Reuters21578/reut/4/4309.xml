<TITLE>ANHEUSER-BUSCH &lt;BUD&gt; SELLS SINKING FUND DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Anheuser-Busch Cos is raising 150 mln
dlrs through an offering of sinking fund debentures due 2017
yielding 8.593 pct, said sole manager Dillon, Read and Co Inc.
    The debentures have an 8-1/2 pct coupon and were priced at
99 to yield 97 basis points over the off-the-run 9-1/4 pct
Treasury bonds of 2016.
    Non-refundable for 10 years, the issue is rated Aa-3 by
Moody's and AA-minus by S and P. A sinking fund starting in
1998 to retire five pct of the debentures a year can be upped
by 200 pct at the company's option, giving them an estimated
minimum life of 13.9 years and maximum of 20.5 years.
