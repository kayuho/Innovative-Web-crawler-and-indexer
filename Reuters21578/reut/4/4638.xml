<TITLE>SWISS FEBRUARY TRADE DEFICIT 629.7 MLN FRANCS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BERNE, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Switzerland had a trade deficit of 629.7
mln Swiss francs in February compared with a revised 209.4 mln
deficit in January and 723.2 mln shortfall in February 1986,
the Federal Customs Office said.
    February imports were 6.00 billion francs against exports
of 5.37 billion.
    Imports rose in real terms by 5.1 pct against February 1986
while exports rose by a real 4.6 pct, the office said.
    But a further improvement in the terms of trade left the
deficit smaller than last year.
    Last February's figure had also been hit by the import of
two passenger aircraft.
