<TITLE>KLM SEEKS STAKE IN BRITISH COURIER SERVICE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>KLM Royal Dutch Airlines &lt;KLM.AS&gt;
said it is negotiating for a minority stake in a British and
Commonwealth Shipping Plc &lt;BCOM.L&gt; courier service in a
transaction which might include a convertible loan issue.
    KLM, already active in the fast growing door-to-door
delivery market through a 50-pct stake in a Dutch courier
service, is seeking to buy one-third of &lt;IML Air Services Group
Ltd&gt; from British and Commonwealth.
    The two companies agreed earlier this month for KLM to take
a 15-pct stake in British and Commonwealth commuter airline Air
U.K. Ltd in a deal worth around two mln stg.
