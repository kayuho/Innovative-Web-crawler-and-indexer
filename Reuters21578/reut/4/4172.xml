<TITLE>TAIWAN TO RELAX IMPORT CURBS ON MORE GOODS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan will relax import controls on
more foreign goods, a government spokesman said today.
    The move was to allow greater access to Taiwan markets by
overseas trading partners, especially the United States, an
official of the Council for Economic Planning and Development
told Reuters.
    Import curbs on about 400 foreign goods, including
stationery and books, would soon be relaxed, he said.
    Taiwan announced it would ease curbs on some 600 farming
and industrial products last month.
    The official said the moves were intended to balance trade
between Taiwan and the United States and other trading
partners. Taiwan's trade surplus reached a record 15.6 billion
dlrs last year, up from 10.62 billion in 1985.
