<TITLE>LOW SUGAR PRICES MAY ATTRACT SOVIET/CHINESE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Any further decline in raw sugar prices
is likely to attract buying from the Soviet Union and China,
Woodhouse, Drake and Carey said in their latest weekly market
report.
    Present lower terminal values may be a reflection of the
lack of renewed prompt offtake, particularly from these two
large consumers, the report said.
    The week has seen good demand for Thai raws, particulary
for October/December shipment, which has traded above twenty
points premium to the October New York delivery, it said.
