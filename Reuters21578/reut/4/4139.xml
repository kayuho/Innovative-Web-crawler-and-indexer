<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
declined comment on the February 22 Paris accord between the

    Asked by reporters after a speech before the National
Fitness Foundation banquet what, if any, currency intervention
levels had been set in Paris, Baker replied: "We never talk
about intervention."

foreign exchange markets' reaction to the accord.
