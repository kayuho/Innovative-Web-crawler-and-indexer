<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE DEMOCRAT, GOP BUDGET WRITERS MEET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>In a step that could lead to a
breakthrough in the drafting of next year's federal budget,
Democratic and Republican members of the House Budget Committee
met behind closed doors to explore the possibility of a
bipartisan budget, lawmakers said.
    No conclusions were reached on whether the two sides would
be able to get together on a budget outline, the lawmakers
said.
    After the meeting broke up, panel Democrats reconvened
behind closed doors for further talks.
