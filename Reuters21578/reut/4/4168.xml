<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Shares in building firm &lt;JM Byggnads
och Fastighets AB&gt; were suspended on the Stockholm bourse at
the company's own request, the bourse said.
    The suspension will last until the end of trading on
Friday, the bourse added in a statement, but gave no further
