<TITLE>POPE EVANS &lt;PER&gt; REPURCHASES SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pope, Evans and Robbins Inc said it
has repurchased 780,000 common shares from Putnam Mills Corp
principals Sidney and Peter Kaplan for 2.25 dlrs per share.
    It said the purchase price will be applied against the
1,700,000 dlrs Putnam Mills currently owes Pope Evans for
merchandise.  Pope Evans has about 7.6 mln shares outstanding.
    The company also said it has agreed in principle to acquire
privately-held Pat Fashions Industries Inc for 18 mln dlrs in
cash and notes, with financing to come partly from bank
borrowings, subject to approval by the Pope Evans board and Pat
shareholders.
    Pat Fashions imports apparel from the Far East and makes
apparel domestically as well.  In the year ended November 30,
Pat earned 5,400,000 dlrs pretax on sales of 83.0 mln dlrs.
