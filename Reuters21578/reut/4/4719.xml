<TITLE>BURMESE PADDY PRODUCTION LOWER IN 1986/87</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RANGOON, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Burma's paddy production fell to 729.4
mln baskets in fiscal year 1986-1987 (to end March) from 737.3
mln in 1985-1986, a cabinet report to parliament said.
    A basket is a local measure equal to 46 lbs.
    Paddy output in 1984-1985 was 699.1 mln baskets, it said.
    Burma's "Green Revolution" sparked by the introduction of
high-yield variety paddy strains in the mid-1970s appears to
have hit a plateau with production levelling off over the past
two years, economists said.
