<TITLE>INTERCONNECT OFFERS TO BUY GATES LEARJET &lt;GLJ&gt;</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STAMFORD, Conn., March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Interconnect Capital Corp&gt;
said it sent a letter to the board of Gates Learjet Corp,
offering to buy the company for 7.07 dlrs a share.
    Gates Corp, which owns 64.8 pct of Gates Learjet, agreed
earlier this week to sell its shares to a partnership formed by
privately-held &lt;Cobey Corp&gt; and a unit of Bear Stearns Cos Inc
&lt;BSC&gt; for 6.50 dlrs a share or 51 mln dlrs. The proposal is
subject to approval by Gates Learjet's board.
    A spokesman for privately-held Interconnect said it made
the new proposal to Gates Learjet's board, but would not say if
it had held talks with the parent company's board.
