<TITLE>BULL TO GET 800 MLN FRANC CASH INFUSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>France's state-owned computer group Cie
des Machines Bull &lt;BULP.PA&gt; is to receive a government cash
infusion of about 800 mln francs in addition to an 800 mln bond
issue with share warrants planned for April, a Finance Ministry
spokeswoman said.
    The capital injection will be in two stages, the first this
year and the second at the start of 1988, she said.
    Earlier this month Bull reported a consolidated net 1986
profit of 271 mln francs compared with 110 mln in the previous
year. It also cited a fall in debt and increasing productivity.
