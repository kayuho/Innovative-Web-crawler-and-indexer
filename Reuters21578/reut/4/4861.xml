<TITLE>WESTINGHOUSE &lt;WX&gt; TO DESIGN BRITISH NUCLEAR UNIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PITTSBURGH, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Westinghouse Electric Corp said it
will perform work valued in excess of 200 mln dlrs on the
1150-megawatt Sizewell B commercial nuclear power station which
the United Kingdom will build near Suffolk on its southeast
coast.
    Westinghouse said it will design and erect the primary
reactor coolant system, manufacture components and transfer
technology for the power plant which the U.K. government
announced plans for yesterday.
    Westinghouse said its technology for the design of the
pressurized water reactor will be transferred through its
licensee in the United Kingdom, &lt;National Nuclear Corp&gt;.
    The company said Britian's national utility, the Central
Electricity Generating Board, has announced plans to apply for
planning consent for a second pressurized water reactor,
Hinkley C in Somerset, before the end of 1987.
    The board has said it would like to build up to five
pressurized water reactors before the end of the century,
Westinghouse added.
