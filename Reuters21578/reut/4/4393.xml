<TITLE>U.S. ISSUES VERIFICATION PROPOSALS AT ARMS TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States made its proposals
for verifying adherence to a prospective treaty on medium range
nuclear weapons and in a highly unusual move made public the
outlines of its recommendations.
    State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters
the proposals were made to the Soviet Union at Geneva arms
control talks today.
    The proposals included on-site inspection that could result
in inspectors from the two superpowers being stationed
permanently on the territory of the other.
