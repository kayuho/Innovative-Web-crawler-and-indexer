<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service said it is
reviewing 648 mln dlrs of securities issued by Atlantic City

    The net effect of the Board's recent ruling was to reduce
the company's rates by 15.9 mln dlrs, Moody's said.
    Ratings under review include the company's first mortgage
