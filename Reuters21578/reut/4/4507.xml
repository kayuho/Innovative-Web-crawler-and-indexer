<TITLE>WRIGHT SAYS A GAS TAX AN OPTION TO CUT DEFICIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Speaker Jim Wright said a
gasoline tax is one option to finding a way to reduce the
deficit, but told reporters in response to a question he will
not try to dictate a solution to the debt problem.
