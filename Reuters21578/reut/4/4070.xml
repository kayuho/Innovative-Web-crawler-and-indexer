<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain's ruling Conservatives have
moved into a six-point lead over the main opposition Labour
Party, a Marplan poll published in today's Guardian newspaper
reports.
    The Conservatives are shown with a 38 pct share of the vote
against 32 pct for Labour and 27 pct for the centrist
Social-Democratic/Liberal Alliance. Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher has until June, 1988 to call a general election, but
most political analysts expect her to go to the country some
time this year.
