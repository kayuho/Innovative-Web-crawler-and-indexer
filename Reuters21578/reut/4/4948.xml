<TITLE>FORMER SANTA FE EXEC ADMITS INSIDER TRADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Darius N. Keaton, former member of the
board of &lt;Santa Fe International Corp&gt;, pleaded guilty to an
insider trading scheme that netted him 274,800 dlrs in profit.
    In Manhattan Federal Court, Keaton pleaded guilty to
trading on non-public information involving his purchase of
10,000 shares of the company's stock in September 1981 shortly
before the company was acquired by Kuwait Petroleum Co in 1982
for two billion dlrs.
    Keaton, 62, of Monterey, Calif., admitted he failed to
report the purchase to the Securities and Exchange Commission,
and admitted commiting wire fraud stemming from his
transaction.
    He faces up to 10 years in prison on both counts, and a
fine of 11,000 dlrs when he is sentenced by Judge Whitman Knapp
on June 1.
