<TITLE>IGENE BIOTECHNOLOGY &lt;IGNE&gt; FINDS CROP LOSS AID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    COLUMBIA, Md., March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>IGENE Biotechnology Inc said its
research teams at Auburn and Hebrew universities have found its
patented pesticide is highly effective in combating a disease
reponsible for approximately three billion dlrs in annual crop
losses.
    The company said it learned ClandoSan controls nematodes,
deadly plant pathogens formerly controlled by now-banned
synthetic chemicals.
    Varieties of the deadly disease attack major cash crops
such as cotton, vegetables, orchard trees, citrus fruits, and
garden plants, the company said.
