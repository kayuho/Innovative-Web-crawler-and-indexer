<TITLE>UNOCAL &lt;UCL&gt; RAISES CRUDE OIL POSTINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Unocal Corp said it raised the
contract price it will pay for most grades of crude oil 50 cts
a barrel, effective today.
    The increase brings Unocal's posted price for the U.S.
benchmark grade West Texas Intermediate to 17.50 dlrs a barrel.
It also brought the price for West Texas Sour to 17.50 dlrs a
bbl. Light Louisiana Sweet was also raised 50 cts to 17.85
dlrs/bbl.
    Unocal last changed its crude postings on March four, and
brings it price in line with other major companies, which have
been raising prices steadily in recent weeks.
    The increase also represents the latest in a series of
increases that began with USX Corp's &lt;X&gt; Marathon Petroleum
Corp's notification yesterday evening that, effective today, it
raised its crude postings 50 cts a barrel, bringing its
contract price for WTI to 17.50 dlrs a barrel.
    Earlier today, Sun Co &lt;SUN&gt;, Phillips Petroleum &lt;P&gt; and
Diamond Shamrock &lt;DIA&gt; also said they raised their crude
postings 50 cts a barrel, bringing their WTI contract price to
17.50 dlrs a barrel.
    Contract prices have risen in response to higher spot
market prices, oil traders said.
