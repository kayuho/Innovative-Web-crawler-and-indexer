<TITLE>FED NOT EXPECTED TO ADD RESERVES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve is not expected to
intervene in the government securities market today, several
economists said.
    They said the Fed does not have a much of an adding need
this week and may wait until tomorrow or Monday before
supplying reserves.
    But a few economists said there was an outside chance that
the Fed may inject reserves indirectly via a small round of
customer repurchase agreements.
    Federal funds hovered at 6-1/8 pct this morning after
averaging 6.32 pct yesterday.
