<TITLE>KODAK &lt;EK&gt; REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO PHOTOGRAPHY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROCHESTER, N.Y., March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eastman Kodak Co said it will
build a major facility here for the production of color film,
reaffirming its commitment to its core photographic business.
    Kodak said the plant will cost more than 200 mln dlrs to
build and will be staffed by about 250 people who will be
transferred from existing manufacturing operations. It said the
plant should be operational by the fall of 1990.
    Kodak said it does not intend to shut down any current
capacity as anticipated growth in demand for photography
products will "offset the additional capacity."
    The company also said the facility will position it "well
into the 21st century," in the photography business. It said
the plant will initially produce color films for the
professional and motion picture industry.
    Kodak also said it will maintain its Rochester site as the
center of its photographic technology operations. "We have been
encourgaged that in recent years this community and New York
state have been working hard to improve the business climate
for manufucturing," said William F. Fowble, Kodak's sernior
vice-presient and general manager of manufacturing. "We assume
thesse efforts will continue."
