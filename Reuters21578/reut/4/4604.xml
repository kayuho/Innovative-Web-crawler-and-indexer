<TITLE>INDIA GETS 140 MLN DLR WORLD BANK LOAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>The World Bank said it approved a
140 mln dlr loan for India to help lessen that country's
dependence on imported oil and spur development of its own
petroleum resources.
    The bank said the loan will be used to boost production by
injecting gas in the partially depleted Assam oil fields and to
assist exploration in other areas, including drilling 10
exploratory wells.
    The bank said the recipient of the 20-year loan will be Oil
India Ltd (OIL), which is the smaller of two public Indian
petroleum exploration and production companies.
