<TITLE>JACOBS SUCHARD SEES 100,000 TONNE COCOA SURPLUS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Jacobs Suchard AG expects a world cocoa
surplus of around 100,000 tonnes in 1987 compared with a
104,000 tonne surplus in 1986, Jens Sroka, head of commodity
buying, told a news conference.
    The company expects prices to remain at around current
levels despite the likelihood of agreement on buffer stock
rules at the forthcoming London cocoa talks, and believes
market intervention by the buffer stock manager would stabilise
prices.
    Sroka said world coffee prices are expected to remain weak
if any international coffee talks fail to produce agreement.
    Sroka said stagnating consumption and slight overproduction
will continue to weigh on coffee prices and he forecast a
continued build-up in stocks.
    The recent failure of the London coffee talks had surprised
market observers.
    Unless reason prevails and the major producers return to
the conference table, the world coffee market will remain free
and the consequences for some producers dependant on coffee for
their foreign exchange earnings would be catastrophic, Sroka
added.
