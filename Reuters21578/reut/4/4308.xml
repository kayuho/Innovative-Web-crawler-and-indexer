<TITLE>AMERICAN CENTURY CORP &lt;ACT&gt; GETS INJUNCTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN ANTONIO, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Century Corp said it was
granted an injunction against Merrill Lynch and certain
affiliates barring them from taking or selling any of the
collateral for a 12 mln dlr line of credit extended by Merrill.
    American said State District Judge Fred Biery granted the
injunction in connection with a suit filed by &lt;G.H.Stool&gt;
against Merrill Lynch in November 1986.
    Under the order, Merrill Lynch is barred from taking or
selling the collateral, namely 32 pct of the outstanding
American Century shares plus real estate interests, for the
credit line extended to &lt;G.H. Stool&gt;, American's chairman John
Kerr and Robert Feldman, a director with American.
    The company said the suit seeks punitive and actual
damanges from Merrill Lynch for fraud and refusing to honor
what it contends was a binding commitment to a extend and
increase the loan to provide the financing to acquire 100 pct
of the American Century shares.
