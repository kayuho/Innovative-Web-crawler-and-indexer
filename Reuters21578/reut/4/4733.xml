<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>First Boston Inc said it has started
its previously-announced tender offer for all common shares,
2.19 dlr cumulative preference shares and 11.25 dlr convertible
preferred shares of Allegheny International Inc at 24.60 dlrs,
20.00 dlrs and 87.50 dlrs respectively.

    Receipt of the minimum amounts under the offer would give
First Boston sufficient voting power to assure approval of the
merger without the affirmative vote of any other shareholder,
