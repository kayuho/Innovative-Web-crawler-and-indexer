<TITLE>KAMPUCHEA SAYS RICE CROP IN 1986 INCREASED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kampuchea harvested more than two mln
tonnes of rice paddy in 1986, up on the crops of the previous
two years, the official SPK news agency said yesterday.
    Diplomats said estimates put the 1985 harvest at less than
one mln tonnes, slightly up on 800,000 in 1984.
    SPK said Kampuchea planned to expand planting from 1.5 mln
to 1.93 mln hectares and boost rice paddy output to 2.5 mln
tonnes this calendar year.
    Two mln tonnes of paddy would produce some 1.3 mln tonnes
of milled rice, above the 1.25 mln tonnes Kampuchea says is the
minimum its 7.5 mln people need.
