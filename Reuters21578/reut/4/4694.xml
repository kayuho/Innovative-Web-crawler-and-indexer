<TITLE> FRANCE EXPECTS TO SIGN DISNEYLAND CONTRACT BY NEXT MONTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The French government and Walt Disney Co
 &lt;DIS.N&gt; expect to sign a contract for Europe's first
Disneyland amusement park before the end of next month, a
senior French official said today.
    The complex, to be built 20 miles east of Paris, will
include a so-called "Magic Kingdom" theme park, outdoor
recreation, shops and hotels.
    Initial investment by Walt Disney and a group of French and
other investors has been put at around eight billion francs for
the project's central theme park.
    A preliminary agreement was reached in December 1985.
