<TITLE>EC INCREASES SPECIAL FEED WHEAT TENDERS - TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community (EC) has increased
the size of two special export tenders for British and West
German feed wheat held in intervention stores and included
South Korea as an acceptable destination, traders said.
    The tender was originally for 120,000 tonnes of British and
120,000 tonnes of West German feed wheat for shipment only to
Poland.
    But now both tranches have been increased by 50,000 tonnes
to 170,000 tonnes with South Korea added as a possible
destination. Both tenders are open from June 24.
