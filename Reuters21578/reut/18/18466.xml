<TITLE>CHINA MOVES TO STABILISE WORLD TUNGSTEN PRICES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>China is moving to stabilise world prices
of tungsten after fluctuating prices this year affected the
country's export earnings, the China Daily said.
    The paper quoted industry officials as saying they would
fix export prices on the basis of the world market, stop
smuggling and encourage producers to reduce exports.
    Current world prices range from 49 to 55 dlrs per tonne
unit, but China suffered heavy losses when the price slumped to
39 dlrs earlier this year, it said.
    Some 45 pct of world tungsten exports come from China, but
the country imports high-grade tungsten products.
