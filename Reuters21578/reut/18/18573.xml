<TITLE>DOME &lt;DMP&gt; SHAREHOLDER FILES CLASS ACTION SUIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CALGARY, Alberta, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dome Petroleum Ltd said one of
its common shareholders filed a class action suit in a New York
court alleging the company, its chairman and president breached
their fiduciary duties concerning Amoco Corp's proposed
takeover of Dome.
    Dome said the suit, filed by counsel representing Allen B.
DeYoung, who holds 100 Dome common shares, names Dome, chairman
J. Howard Macdonald, president John Beddome as defendents, as
well as Amoco and Amoco's Canadian unit Amoco Canada Petroleum
Co Ltd.
    Dome said the class action suit, filed in United States
district court in New York, seeks a court order declaring the
Dome-Amoco takeover null and void or compensation in excess of
100 mln dlrs in actual damages, plus compensation for any
consequential damages.
    The suit also seeks to block a provision in the merger
agreement for Dome to sell to Amoco its Primrose, Alberta,
heavy oil properties for 79 mln dlrs if the takeover is not
completed.
