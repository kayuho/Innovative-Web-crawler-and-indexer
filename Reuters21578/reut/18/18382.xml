<TITLE>WINTER DAMAGE TO POLISH RAPESEED SEEN MINOR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Despite the past severe winter,
damage to rapeseed acreage in Poland appears to be minor, the
U.S. Agriculture Department's Counselor in Warsaw said in a
field report.
    The report, dated June 11, said official statements show
that about 40,000 hectares, less than 10 pct of sown area, was
plowed under this year compared with the usual 15 pct.
    Rapeseed production is forecast at 1.1 mln tonnes, 200,000
tonnes below the record crop produced in 1986, but 35 pct above
previous forecasts, the report said.
