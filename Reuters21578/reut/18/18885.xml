<TITLE>WORLD BANK LOANS PAKISTAN 220 MLN DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The World Bank said it has extended
Pakistan 220 mln dlrs in three loans to support projects in
education, energy conservation and modernization, and
small-scale industry development.
    The education project will be supported by a 145 mln dlr
loan through the International Development Association, the
bank's concessionary lending affiliate, the bank said.
    The bank noted Pakistan's low educational attainment,
particularly among women, is an obstacle to the country's
development.
    It said the education project aims to increase literacy and
school enrollment rates through curriculum reform, teacher
training, parental participation and school construction.
    A small-scale industry development project will be
supported by a 54 mln dlr loan, the bank said.
    The project hopes to aid small-scale industry by
encouraging bank lending, developing export markets, and
supporting technology transfer, the bank said.
    The third project, to improve refinery efficiency, reduce
energy consumption and increase crude oil processing capacity,
will be supported by a 21 mln dlr loan.
