<TITLE>MICROELECTRONICS TO RESTRUCTURE PROGRAM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AUSTIN, Texas, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Microelectronics and Computer
Technology Corp&gt; said its board approved a restructuring of its
advanced computer architecture program.
    The private sector cooperative research venture, which is
owned by 20 U.S. companies, said the restructuring is based on
a study by its technical advisory board. The study occurred due
to changing requirements, the company said.
    Formerly comprised of four separate projects, the program
will now have a central resaerch core and three laboratories
called satellites. The work in the core program will focus on
long-range research, the company said.
