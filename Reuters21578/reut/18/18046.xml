<TITLE>FRESH DEBATE ON NORWAY'S EC MEMBERSHIP WELCOMED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     OSLO, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community officials welcomed
Norway's recent move to renew a public debate on Community
membership but said Norway should not expect special trade
advantages as long as it stays outside the EC.
    Belgian Willy de Clercq, EC Commissioner on external
affairs and trade policy, said high level talks this week with
Norway's minority Labour government had helped clarify several
misconceptions that led to Norway's narrow rejection of EC
membership in a 1972 referendum.
    "But you (Norway) cannot be in the club and remain outside
the club. You can expect equal footing in the club, but not out
of it," de Clercq added, referring to Norway's attempts to adapt
its EC trade ties in the face of Community moves to launch an
internal trade market from 1992.
    The government, worried that the internal market will
hamper trade with the EC, which takes about two-thirds of
Norway's exports, last month sent a report to parliament asking
political parties and the public to reassess the country's
relationship to the EC.
