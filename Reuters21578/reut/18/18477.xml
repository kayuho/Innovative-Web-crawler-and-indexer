<TITLE>UAE LEADERS REJECT OVERTHROW OF SHARJAH RULER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Supreme Council of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) has rejected the overthrow of the ruler of the
emirate of Sharjah, the Emirates news agency, WAM, reported.
    The UAE was plunged into a constitutional crisis yesterday
after the ruling family of Sharjah said its ruler Sheikh Sultan
bin Mohammed al-Qassimi had abdicated in favour of one of his
brothers because of financial mismanagement.
    The Council is the highest federal authority in the UAE,
comprising the rulers of the seven emirates which make up the
group, but it has no power over the internal affairs of
individual states, diplomatic sources said.
    The Supreme Council met in emergency session, without a
representative from Sharjah, under the chairmanship of UAE
President Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan al-Nahayan, WAM said.
    It decided to ignore all statements issued from Sharjah and
would continue meeting until the issue was resolved, the agency
added.
    The Qatar news agency said Sheikh Sultan was in Dubai after
flying back from a private visit to London. The emirate of
Dubai has rejected the Sharjah explanation and said Sheikh
Sultan was ousted by force. It said this was unacceptable and
called for his reinstatement. The UAE was formed in 1971.
