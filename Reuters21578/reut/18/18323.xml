<DATELINE>    MEXICO CITY, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mexico has no intention of leaving
the International Coffee Organization (ICO), in the event of
Brazil withdrawing from the group, the Mexican Coffee Institute
(IMC) said.

instrument for ensuring producers obtain an adequate price.

coffee per year.

if its export quota was reduced by the organization.
