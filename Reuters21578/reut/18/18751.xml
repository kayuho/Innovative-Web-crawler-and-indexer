<TITLE>BECOR WESTERN &lt;BCW&gt;AGAIN ADJOURNS HOLDER MEETING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SOUTH MILWAUKEE, Wis., June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Becor Western Inc said its
reconvened shareholders meeting has been adjourned to 1000 CDT
June 30.
    The company had previously announced plans to again adjourn
the meeting following receipt of a renewed offer from Lynch
Corp &lt;LGL&gt; yesterday.
    The meeting was originally convened on June four when
shareholders approved the sale of Becor's Western Gear Corp
subsidiary before adjourning. The remaining matter to be
presented is the proposed acquisition of Becor by BCW
Acquisition Inc, now one of four offers for the company./
