<TITLE>SENATE CLEARS WAY FOR PASSAGE OF MONEY BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Senate cleared away a
parliamentary obstacle threatening final passage of a 9.4
billion dlr money bill for the rest of fiscal 1987 ending
October 1.
    The Senate voted 64 to 32 to override objections the bill's
money total violated the 1987 budget, a vote that required 60
votes for approval.
    The House-passed measure, debated by the Senate since May
7, carries funds for most government activities with the bulk
--6.7 billion dlrs--for agriculture support programs.
    Final passage could come late tonight or tomorrow.
