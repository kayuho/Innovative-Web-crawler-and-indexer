<TITLE>STRONG DEMAND FOR PERU BISMUTH IN JAN/MAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Very strong demand from all markets
including, recently, Japan has resulted in Peru's bismuth
exports showing an impressive increase in January/May 1987,
Peru's state owned mining industry's marketing arm Minpeco S.A.
Said.
    In a statement released by its London office, Minpeco said
Peruvian customs figures for bismuth exports for the first five
months were 574.8 tonnes compared with 160.7 tonnes in the same
period of 1986 and 483.4 tonnes during the whole of 1986,
Minpeco said.
    A breakdown of the figures showed Peru exported 296.4
tonnes of bismuth to the U.S. During Jan/May 1987 compared with
127.0 during the whole of 1986. Other recipients were Peoples
Republic of China 110.4 (100.0), Holland 100.2 (150.0), USSR
50.0 (50.0) and other areas 17.8 tonnes (56.4).
    Sales to the U.K., West Germany, France and other Western
and Eastern European countries are hidden under the heading
Holland as Minpeco sells to customers in these countries from
stocks the company normally holds in Rotterdam, the statement
said.
