<TITLE>PAY 'N PAK &lt;PNP&gt; RECEIVES AMENDED PROPOSAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KENT, Wash., June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pay 'N Pak Stores Inc said it
received a revision to one of the two previously disclosed
proposals to buy the company.
    Pay 'N Pak said that the proposal from a leveraged buyout
firm had been amended to increase the dividend rate on the
cumulative preferred stock to be received by PNP shareholders
from 13.5 pct to 17.5 pct.
    As previoiusly announced, the proposal calls for a
transaction in which PNP shareholders would receive a
combination of 17.50 dlrs in cash and 2.50 dlrs in liquidation
value of cumulative preferred stock for each common share.
   
    Under the other proposal received from Paul Bilzerian, PNP
shareholders would receive on a blended basis 16.67 dlrs in
cash and 3.33 dlrs in liquidation value of cumulative
redeemable preferred stock for each common share, the company
said.
    Under the Bilzerian proposal, the dividend rate on the
preferred stock would be set so that in the joint opinion of
the financial advisor to Bilzerian and the financial advisor to
Pay 'N Pak, the preferred stock would trade at its liquidation
value on a fully distributed basis, the company said.
