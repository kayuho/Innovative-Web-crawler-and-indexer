<TITLE>UAW CHIEF DISPLEASED WITH GREENSPAN APPOINTMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>United Automobile Workers union president
Owen Bieber said he was pleased Paul Volcker is leaving as
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board but not encouraged at
Alan Greenspan's nomination to succeed him.
    "When you say Greenspan in now in view, that troubles me,"
the UAW leader told reporters at a news conference.
    Bieber, whose union has 1.1 mln members, said that with
Greenspan heading the Fed, "I'm afraid it means a continuation
of the same policies we've been on, which I don't think are the
right policies."
