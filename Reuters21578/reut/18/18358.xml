<TITLE>FIRMS AWARDED U.S. POSTAL SERVICE AWARDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Postal Service said Unisys Corp
&lt;UIS&gt;, Bell and Howell Co &lt;BHW&gt;, Recognition Equipment Inc
&lt;REC&gt;, Toshiba and AEG, were awarded contracts for automating
the postal services mail sorting system.
    The Postal Service said the contracts will lead to increase
use of multiline optical character readers. Based on the
outcome of next summer's tests, the Postal Service said it will
decide whether to buy only new equipment or combine new
purchases with some of its older equipment.
    It also said a test of a kit under a previous contract was
successfully completed by ElectroCom Automation Inc.
