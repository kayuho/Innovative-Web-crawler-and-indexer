<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The World Bank said it approved a
97.4 mln dlr loan for China to help boost fertilizer output in

efficiency of medium-scale fertilizer plants through technical
renovations and energy conservation, the bank said.

nutrient imbalances by building the capacity for phosphate
