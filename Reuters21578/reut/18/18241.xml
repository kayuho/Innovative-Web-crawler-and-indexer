<TITLE>NUCLEAR DATA &lt;NDI&gt; FINANCIAL DATA QUALIFIED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SCHAUMBURG, ILL., June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nuclear Data Inc said its
auditors, Ernst and Whinney, quaified their opinion on its
financial statements for the fiscal year ended February 28.
    As previously reported, Nuclear Data's bank debt matures on
June 30, 1987, and its lenders have required it to obtain
replacement financing by then.
    It said the auditors qualified their opinion because the
company does not yet have a commitment for replacement
financing. Nuclear Data said it expects to have such financing
in place shortly.
