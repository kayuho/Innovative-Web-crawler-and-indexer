<TITLE>U.S. SENATORS PROPOSE BAN ON TOSHIBA IMPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Three U.S. Senators said they will
propose a temporary ban on imports of all Toshiba products due
to the company's illegal sales of sensitive high-technology
goods to the Soviet Union.
    Senator Jake Garn, John Heinz and Richard Selby said at a
hearing of the senate banking committee on export control, they
will offer the proposal as part of a major trade bill when it
is brought before the senate this summer.
    Garn, a Utah Republican, said "I am talking about specific
retribution on a company that endangers the security of their
own country and ours."
