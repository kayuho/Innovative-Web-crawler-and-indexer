<TITLE>PUTNAM LAUNHCES NEW GLOBAL INCOME FUND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOSTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Putnam Financial Services Inc said its
newest fund offering, Putnam Global Governmental Income Trust,
is among the few global funds with an investment objective of
high current income through a portfolio of mainly government
bonds.
    Putnam claimed the trust allows investor money to go where
the best yields are found worldwide, yet investors still have
the assurance of governmental obligations.
