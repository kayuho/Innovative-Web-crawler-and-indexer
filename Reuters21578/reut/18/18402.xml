<TITLE>USX &lt;X&gt;/WORTHINGTON PLANT REACHES DESIGN LEVELS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JACKSON, Mich., June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>USX Corp said it and Worthington
Industries &lt;WTHG.O&gt; Inc's Worthingon Specialty Products steel
processing plant in Jackson, Mich., has recently reached
production at the levels for which it was designed.
    The company said the 600,000 short ton per year plant is
designed to provide automotive, appliance and other customers
with first-stage processed steel for just-in-time delivery.
    It opened in August 1986, just as USX was beginning a
six-month labor dispute. USX is sourcing the plant with coils
from its Gary, Ind., works and Mon Valley Works near
Pittsburgh, and Worthington is operating the plant.
