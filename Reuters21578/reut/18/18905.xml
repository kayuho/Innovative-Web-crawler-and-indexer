<TITLE>NORTH AMERICAN &lt;NBIO.O&gt; GETS FINANCING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MIAMI, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>North American Biologicals Inc said it has
received a 10 mln dlr credit facility from Manufacturers and
Traders Trust Co of Buffalo, N.Y.
    It said the new credit would replace an existing 4.4 mln
dlr line with Barclays PLC &lt;BCS.L&gt;, and due to more favorable
interest rates, borrowing costs should be significantly
reduced.
    The company said half of the credit is designated for use
in acquisitions.  It said it expects to conclude an
acquisition, possibly outside its plasma and serum field, by
year-end.
