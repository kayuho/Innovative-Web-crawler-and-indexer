&lt;MC.T&gt;, Mazda Motor Corp &lt;MAZT.T&gt; and Ford Motor Co &lt;F&gt; have
signed an agreement to set up a joint venture to make car air
conditioners in Japan, Matsushita said in a statement.
    The new venture, &lt;Japan Climate Systems Corp&gt; will be
capitalised at 1.5 billion yen, and the three partners will
hold equal shares.
    The partners will invest 3.6 billion yen in constructing a
plant in Hiroshima, due for completion in late 1988. The plant
will initially make 100,000 air conditioners a year for Mazda,
it said.
