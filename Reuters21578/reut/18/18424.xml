<TITLE>TAIWAN ISSUES MORE CDS TO CURB MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Central Bank has issued 8.29 billion
Taiwan dlrs worth of certificates of deposit (CDs), raising
total CD issues so far this year to 228.27 billion, a bank
official told Reuters.
    The CDs, with maturities of six months, one and two years,
bear interest rates ranging from 4.05 to 5.25 pct, she said.
    The issues are intended to help curb the growth of the M-1b
money supply which is expanding due to the rise in Taiwan's
foreign exchange reserves, now at some 60 billion U.S. Dlrs.
