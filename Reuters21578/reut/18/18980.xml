<TITLE>KRAFT &lt;KRA&gt; DEFENDS CHEESE ADVERTISING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kraft Inc said it strongly disagreed
with a complaint filed by the Federal Trade Commission that it
made false and misleading claims about its Kraft Singles cheese
product and said it would fight the charge.
    "Kraft has always been committed to informative and
truthful advertising and this compaign clearly meets those
criteria," Kraft said in a prepared statement.
    "We believe the integreity of the advertising will be
established through the litigation process," Kraft said.
    Company spokesman Scott Horne said he could not elaborate
on the statement because the case is being litigated.
    The FTC charged Kraft with making false and misleading
claims in its advertising by overstating the calcuim content of
its Kraft Singles American Pasteurized Process Cheese Food.
    In an administrative complaint, the FTC charged the
Glenview, Ill., food and consumer products company with falsely
claiming that a slice of Kraft Singles contains the same amount
of calcium as five ounces of milk.
    The company also falsely advertised that Kraft Singles
contain more calcium than most slices of imitation cheese and
that it could substantiate its claims, the FTC charged.
