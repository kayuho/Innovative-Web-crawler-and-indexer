<TITLE>CONCERN IN BRAZIL OVER VOLCKER DEPARTURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian officials are privately
expressing concern that the change of command at the Federal
Reserve may lead to a tougher U.S. Policy on debt and less
understanding of the problems of the Third World.
    Paul Volcker, head of the Federal Reserve, was considered
here to be understanding of Brazil's difficulties.
    A Finance Ministry source said of his colleagues in the
ministry: "They are a bit apprehensive about (Alan) Greenspan
(who will replace Volcker), considering his reputation as a
very tough man, an advocate of recessive measures to
counter-attack inflation. There is a little bit of concern."
