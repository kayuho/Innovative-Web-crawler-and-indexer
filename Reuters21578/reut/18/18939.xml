<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The World Bank said it approved a
97.4 mln dlr loan for China to help boost fertilizer output in
order to increase agricultural production.
    The 20-year loan supports a project aimed at improving the
efficiency of medium-scale fertilizer plants through technical
renovations and energy conservation, the bank said.
    It said the project also seeks to reduce agricultural
nutrient imbalances by building the capacity for phosphate
fertilizer production and to improve institutional efficiency
by introducing modern economic, financial and operational
