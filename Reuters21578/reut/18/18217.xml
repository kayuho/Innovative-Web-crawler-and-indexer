<TITLE>B.F. GOODRICH &lt;GR&gt;  CANADA STUDIES PLANT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Quebec government said it joined
with B.F. Goodrich Canada Inc to study the feasability of
building a vinyl chloride monomer plant in Montreal. The plant
would supply manufacturers of PVC construction and other
materials in Eastern Canada and the Northeastern U.S.,
government officials said.
    Theys said the  plant would cost about 125 mln Canadian
dlrs, with production beginning in 1991 if economic conditions
are right. more
    The Quebec government has said it wants the project to
proceed because it would provide future demand for Petromont
Inc petrochemical products. Petromont is jointly owned by Union
Carbide Canada Ltd &lt;UCC.TO&gt; and the Quebec government's SGF
industrial development group. Its Montreal plant would provide
ethylene as a raw material for the project.
     Quebec said it also wants Interprovincial Pipe Line Ltd
&lt;IPIPF.O&gt; to adapt its pipeline from Sarnia, Ont., to Montreal
to carry natural gas liquids, a decision that will be made by
the federal National Energy Board. It said the pipeline could
provide Petromont with feedstock at one-third the cost of
moving it by rail.
