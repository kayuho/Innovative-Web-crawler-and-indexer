<TITLE>AMERICAN MICRO SIGNS THREE-YEAR SERVICE PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TUSTIN, Calif., June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;American Micro Technology Co&gt;
said it signed a three-year installation and service agreement
with TRW Inc &lt;TRW&gt;.
    Under the agreement, TRW initially will provide on-site
installation and service of AMT's full line of PC compatible
products in a 100-mile radius of 12 major cities, which
represent more than two-thirds of the PC market, American Micro
said.
    The company said the pact allows it to pursue government
bids which require installation and service support.
