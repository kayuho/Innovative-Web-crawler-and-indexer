<TITLE>ISO DEFERS DEBATE ON BUDGET CONTRIBUTIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>An International Sugar Organization (ISO)
committee discussed the terms of a new administrative
International Sugar Agreement but did not debate the most
controversial area of budget contributions, delegates said.
    Progress was made in a number of technical areas, but with
one of the main importers, the Soviet Union, unable to attend
because of prior commitments, the distribution of votes and
contributions was not raised, an ISO spokesman said.
    Delegates said private meetings are also taking place
between the main participants to discuss the details of the new
agreement. The committee is due to meet again tomorrow.
