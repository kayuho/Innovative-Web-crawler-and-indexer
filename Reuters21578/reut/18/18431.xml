<TITLE>JAPAN BUYS 50,000 TONNES OF CANADIAN RAPESEED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese crushers have so far bought
50,000 tonnes of Canadian rapeseed for shipment in late
July/August and total purchases for the period are likely to be
around 130,000 tonnes, trade sources said.
    Crushers reduced their Canadian purchases for late June and
July to 111,000 from 120,000 tonnes due to seasonal maintenance
work at oil mills.
    But estimated crushers' buying for July/August was slightly
above monthly average and is likely to keep to this level for a
while due to a better crushing margin compared with that of
soybeans, they said.
