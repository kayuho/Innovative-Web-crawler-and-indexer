<TITLE>SENATOR SAYS REAGAN FARM REFORM PLANS DOOMED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Washington, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senator Kent Conrad, D-ND, said
President Reagan's goal of phasing-out world farm subsidies by
the year 2000 is doomed to failure because the European
Community, EC, will not accept it.
    "It (Reagan plan) is a nonstarter. Its absolutely crystal
clear they (EC) have no intention of eliminating subsidies,"
said Conrad on his return from a four-day visit to Europe.
    Instead of proposing an end to farm subsidies, he said the
U.S. should adopt some of the EC Common Agricultural Policy,
CAP, principles by seeking a "compromise" agreement with
Brussels to jointly reduce production, and apply a two-price
system of high domestic and low export prices. Under the plan,
export subsidies would bridge domestic and world price gaps,
said Conrad, a new member of the Senate Agriculture Committee.
