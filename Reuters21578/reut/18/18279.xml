<TITLE>BILL WITH FARM MONEY NEARS U.S. SENATE OKAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Senate cleared away a
parliamentary obstacle threatening final passage of a 9.4
billion dlr money bill for the rest of fiscal 1987.
    The Senate voted 64 to 32 to override objections the bill's
money total violated the 1987 budget, a vote that required 60
votes for approval.
    The House-passed measure, debated by the Senate since May
7, carries funds for most government activities with the bulk,
6.7 billion dlrs, for agriculture support programs.
    Final passage could come late tonight or tomorrow.
