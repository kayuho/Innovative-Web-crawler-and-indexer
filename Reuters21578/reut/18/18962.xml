<TITLE>CARTER HAWLEY &lt;CHH&gt; SETS RECORD DATE FOR VOTE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc said
it has set June 29 as the record date for shareholders voting
on the company's proposed restructuring at its annual meeting.
    The company has yet to set a date for the meeting, but has
said it will be held before the end of August.
    Under the proposal, Carter Hawley would split into a
specialty store company and a department store company.
    Shareholders would get 17-dlrs in cash and a share in each
of the two new companies for each existing common share they
hold. The restructuring was announced in December, after Carter
Hawley rejected a buy-out offer by Retail Partners.
