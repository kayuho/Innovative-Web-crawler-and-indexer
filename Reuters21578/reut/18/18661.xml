<TITLE>BRAZILIAN UNION PROPOSES GENERAL STRIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The national executive of Brazil's
most militant trade union group has proposed a general strike
for July 15 in protest at the government's austerity program.
    A spokeswoman for the Workers' Confederation (CUT) told
Reuters the proposal would be discussed within the trade union
movement. On Friday the government of President Jose Sarney
introduced austerity measures to try to combat the country's
high inflation rate, currently running at more than 1,000 pct a
year.
    It scrapped a trigger mechanism which had guaranteed
regular pay rises in line with high inflation.
    Trade unions say real wages are dropping by about a third.
