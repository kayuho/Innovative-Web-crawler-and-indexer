<TITLE>FORCE MAJEURE LIFTED AT CAJAMARQUILLA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LIMA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Peru's state minerals marketing arm, Minero
Peru Comercial SA (Minpeco), lifted a force majeure on zinc
ingot shipments from the country's biggest zinc refinery at
Cajamarquilla, a spokesman said.
    The spokesman said the problems affecting sulphuric acid
and roaster plants that had halted production since May 4 had
been resolved.
    However, he said production of zinc ingots this year was
expected to fall to around 86,000 tonnes this year at
Cajamarquilla, from 94,000 tonnes in 1986 because of the
stoppage.
    The refinery has an optimum annual production capacity of
100,000 tonnes but its highest production was 96,000 tonnes of
refined zinc ingots in 1985, the spokesman said.
