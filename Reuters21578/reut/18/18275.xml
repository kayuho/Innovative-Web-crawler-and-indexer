<TITLE>USDA SETS 0/92 PROVISION FOR SOME PRODUCERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Some producers in the 1987 acreage
reduction program may be eligible for deficiency payments on 92
pct of their enrolled acreage even though none of it is planted
with wheat or other program crops, the U.S. Agriculture
Department said.
    The department said the provision of the Farm Disaster
Assistance Act will be available to all eligible winter wheat
producers, producers of other types of wheat who were prevented
from planting their 1987 wheat crop because of a 1986 natural
disaster, and all producers who operate farms with program crop
acreage bases subject to flooding on 50 pct of such crop's
permitted acreage.
    A producer who did not enroll in the 1987 acreage reduction
program may become eligible by signing-up no later than July
15. Producers will be informed by the local offices when
applications are being accepted, it said.
    The department said producers of wheat other than winter
wheat may use the 0/92 option if they were preventedf from
planting their intended acreage with wheat for harvest in 1987
because of any natural disasters which occured in 1986 or if
the farm is located in a county approved by Farmers Home
Administration for emergency loans for such disasters that
occurred in 1986.
