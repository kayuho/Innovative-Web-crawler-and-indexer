<TITLE>CENTRAL MAINE &lt;CTP&gt; SEEKS COGENERATOR SPONSORS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AUGUSTA, Maine, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Central Maine Power Co said it
issued a request for proposals for about 150 potential project
sponsors of cogeneration and small power production projects.
    The utility said it has about filled six avoided cost
decrements and is soliciting proposals to fill about 50
megawatts each in the seventh and eighth decrements as defined
by the Maine Public Utilities Commission.
    Central Main said the avoided costs for both decrements
have been established on the basis of costs negotiated between
the utility and Hydro-Quebec for planned power purchase
beginning in 1992.
