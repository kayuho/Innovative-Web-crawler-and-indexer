<TITLE>DUTCH RETAILER VENDEX DELAYS FLOTATION UNTIL 1990</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch retail and services group Vendex
International &lt;VENN.AS&gt; has delayed its flotation from 1988 to
1990, chairman and major shareholder Anton Dreesmann said in an
interview with a Dutch financial daily.
    "We don't need a flotation yet," he told the Financieele
Dagblad, noting he wanted net profit to rise to 400 mln
guilders from last year's 302 mln before moving to the bourse.
    Dreesmann added the flotation might be speeded up if the
company should need a substantial amount of capital for an
attractive major takeover, but he had no prospects yet. Vendex
plans to pay at least 30 pct of profits in dividends.
