<TITLE>DROUGHT THREATENS FAMINE, COCOA DAMAGE IN GHANA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ABIDJAN, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ghana is taking steps to combat imminent
famine in certain areas near its border with Togo following
scant rainfall, Accra Radio reported today.
    The Radio, monitored in Abidjan, said fishing and farming
activities have been disrupted in certain districts around the
Volta region near the eastern coast.
    The report follows a period of unusually dry weather in
both Ghana and the Ivory Coast, which trade sources in Abidjan
said could pose problems for important developing cocoa crops.
    The Accra Radio report said a Ghanaian government
delegation, which visited the Anglo and Ketu districts last
week to investigate reports of food shortages, promised the
people a regular supply of maize, rice and sugar.
    At Anglo, the delegation was told that the Keta Lagoon had
dried up, halting fishing activities, while catches at sea were
poor and crops had failed, all due to lack of rainfall.
