<TITLE>MEPC EXTENDS OFFER FOR OLDHAM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>MEPC Plc &lt;MEPC.L&gt; said that its offer for
&lt;Oldham Estates Ltd&gt; would remain open until further notice.
    On February 26 MEPC made an agreed bid for Oldham based on
a formula reflecting its asset value at 30 September 1986. A
year earlier Oldham's net asset value was put at 531.4 mln stg.
    As of 1 April the valuation used under the formula had
still to be agreed so Oldham had yet to give a firm
recommendation to its shareholders regarding the value of the
the offer.
