<TITLE>UNITED TECH &lt;UTX&gt; SEES NO EARNINGS IMPACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HARTFORD, Conn., April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>United Technologies Corp said
the decision by an international consortium not to develop a
new engine would have no impact on 1987 or 1988 earnings.
    &lt;International Aero Engines&gt;, IAE, 30 pct owned by United
Technologies' Pratt and Whitney division, has decided not to
launch a superfan version of its V2500 engine.
    "We've told analysts that IAE's decision not to launch a
full development program of the IAE superfan for certification
in 1991 will have no short term impact on earnings," a United
Technologies spokesman told Reuters.
    Short term refers to 1987 and 1988, the spokesman said. He
declined to elaborate.
    IAE's other owners are Rolls Royce PLC, &lt;Japanese Aero
Engines Corp&gt;, Fiat SPA and &lt;MTU&gt; of West Germany.
    Analysts are estimating United Technologies will earn 3.75
dlrs to 4.50 dlrs a share in 1987. It reported earnings of 36
cts a share in 1986, which included two large writeoffs.
