<TITLE>COLOMBIA SECURES 1.95 BILLION DLRS OF DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Colombia has secured total borrowings
this year for 1.95 billion dlrs, of which 1.40 billion
correspond to loans arranged before 1986, Director of Public
Credit Mauricio Cabrera said.
    Cabrera said about half of the borrowings would come from
the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.
    He was speaking at a forum for industrialists upon his
return from London where he attended the signing of a 50 mln
dlr floating rate note, Colombia's first such offering on the
euromarket.
    Cabrera reaffirmed that Colombia has no intention of
rescheduling  its foreign debt, which he put at 14.35 billion
dlrs, of which 11.35 billion are from the public sector.
    For the international banking community, Colombia continues
to be "the best house in spite of being in the worst
neighbourhood," he said.
    He said debt servicing will remain a burden in 1987 and
will amount to 34.6 pct of total exports.
