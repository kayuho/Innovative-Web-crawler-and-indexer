<TITLE>SPAIN'S FOREIGN RESERVES RISE IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spain's foreign reserves rose by 905 mln
dlrs in February to total 17.05 billion dlrs, compared with
14.11 billion dlrs in February 1986, Bank of Spain figures
show.
    Under a new accounting system introduced this month,
Spain's foreign reserves now exclude foreign currency held by
financial institutions.
    Under the previous system, Spain's foreign reserves would
have risen by 391 mln dlrs in February, taking into account a
fall of 514 mln dlrs in financial institutions' foreign
currency position.
    In January this year, the Central Bank's foreign reserves
rose by 143 mln dlrs, while financial institutions' foreign
currency position fell by 118 mln dlrs.
