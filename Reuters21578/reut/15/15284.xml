<DATELINE>    ****WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz said the Marines spy case had cast a "heavy shadow" over
his scheduled talks in Moscow next week.

midst of potentially promising discussions with the Soviets,
the discussions take place in a difficult environment generated
by their actions, and these things cast a heavy shadow on our
discussions," he told reporters.
