<TITLE>SOUTH KOREA SIGNS CONTRACTS FOR TWO NUCLEAR PLANTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>State-owned Korea Electric Power Corp
(KEPCO) has signed contracts with three U.S. Firms to supply
equipment and services for its tenth and eleventh nuclear power
plants, a KEPCO spokesman said.
    Combustion Engineering Inc &lt;CSP&gt; will supply pressurised
light-water reactors, General Electric Co &lt;GE&gt; will provide

    Work on the two plants, at Yongkwang in the southwest of
the country, is due to start around June 1988 and be completed
in 1995 and 1996.
    The firms will receive a total of 430 mln dlrs, or 11.5 pct

    The three suppliers were chosen from 13 bidders after
tenders closed in April 1986.
    South Korea operates six atomic stations, is building
another three and has plans for about 20 by the year 2000.
