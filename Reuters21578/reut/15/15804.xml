<TITLE>U.S. CONGRESSMAN INTRODUCES REAGAN SUGAR BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., introduced
in the House of Representatives legislation proposed by the
Reagan administration to slash the U.S. sugar price support, a
spokesman for Porter said.
    The spokesman said the bill was introduced without any
changes from the administration's proposal sent to Congress
last month.
    That plan calls for a cut in the sugar loan rate to 12
cents per pound from 18 cents now. Sugar growers would be
compensated for the price cut with targeted direct payments,
to be gradually phased-out through 1990. The payments to
growers would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs.
    Representatives of sugar growers have rejected the
proposal, saying it would ruin the domestic sugar industry.
