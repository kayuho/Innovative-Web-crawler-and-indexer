<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN SHARE VOLUME HITS FIRST QUARTER RECORD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The value of turnover on the Australian
Stock Exchange (ASX) soared to a record 17.11 billion dlrs in
the first three months of 1987 from 7.50 billion in the
corresponding months of 1986, the ASX said.
    Its statement did not give the previous peak.
    First quarter volume also rose sharply, to 9.95 billion
shares from 4.31 billion a year earlier, it said.
    The record volume reflected increased investment in
Australian companies by local and overseas institutions and the
popularity of gold mining and other resource sector shares, the
ASX said.
    In the nine months ended March 31, turnover value climbed
to 38.52 billion dlrs from 20.72 billion a year earlier, the
ASX said.
    Volume in the nine month period rose to 24.07 billion
shares against 13.15 billion a year earlier, it added.
