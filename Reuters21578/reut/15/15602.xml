<TITLE>NATIONAL COMPUTER &lt;NLCS&gt; SEES EARNINGS GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>National Computer Systems Inc
expects fiscal year earnings to improve by about 20 pct, the
company told analysts, although it said the April 30 first
quarter should show "down earnings and virtually flat
revenues."
    Chairman Charles Oswald said National Computer has taken
steps to improve margins. He said revenues are expected to
increase modestly because of the company's decision to downsize
its leasing business, nonrecurring revenueslast year from a
one-time Texas teacher assessment project and the impact of the
discontinuance of products last year.
    Oswald said National Computer's first quarter results will
be down as a result of a major financial systems sales last
year, a higher effective tax rate and the increased number of
shares outstanding.
    The company said the next three consecutive quarters should
demonstrate "excellent earnings growth."
