<TITLE>ATT &lt;T&gt; DEVELOPS SUPERCONDUCTING WIRE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DENVER, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Telephone and Telegraph Co said
it has developed superconducting wires that can easily be
formed into coils.
    It said when cooled to 91 degrees Kelvin, or 296 degrees
below zero Fahrenheit, the wires conduct electricity without
resistance.
    ATT said the wires are made of a barium-yttrium-copper
oxide compound.  It said while many engineering details remain
to be worked out, "The ability to draw the material into fine
wire and to wind the wire into coils and other forms is key for
many superconductor applications now being considered."
