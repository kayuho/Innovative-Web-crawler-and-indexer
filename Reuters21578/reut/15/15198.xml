<TITLE>COLOMBIA BUSINESS ASKED TO DIVERSIFY FROM COFFEE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Colombia government trade official has
urged the business community to aggressively diversify its
activities and stop relying so heavily on coffee.
    Samuel Alberto Yohai, director of the Foreign Trade
Institute, INCOMEX, said private businessmen should not become
what he called "mental hostages" to coffee, traditionally
Colombia's major export.
    The National Planning Department forecast that in 1987
coffee will account for only one-third of total exports, or
about 1.5 billion dlrs, with oil and energy products making up
another third and non-traditional exports the remainder.
