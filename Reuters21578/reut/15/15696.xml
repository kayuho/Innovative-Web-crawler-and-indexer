<TITLE>FIRE AT TATE/LYLE LONDON JETTY HALTS UNLOADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>No raw sugar is being unloaded at Tate
and Lyles refinery at Silvertown on the River Thames following
a fire yesterday afternoon, Tate and Lyle Plc said.
    The fire destroyed a large sector of the main conveyor from
the raw sugar jetty to the weighhouse.
    The company said it is not yet known how long the jetty
will be out of use but it hoped that by tomorrow unloading of
the bulk carrier Mykon Wave will be able to continue using
temporary arrangements, Tate and Lyle said.
    The Mykon Wave arrived in the port recently with about
18,300 tonnes of bulk sugar from Maputo in Swaziland. About
1,600 tonnes remain to be discharged.
    Five other ships loaded with raw sugar are awaiting at
Silvertown to be discharged, Tate and Lyle added.
