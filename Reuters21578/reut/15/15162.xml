<TITLE>PRESTON CORP &lt;PTRK&gt; SEES FIRST QUARTER LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PRESTON, Md., April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Preston corp said it expects to
report a loss of about 300,000 dlrs or five cts per share for
the first quarter, compared with a profit of 1,081,000 dlrs or
19 cts per share a year before.          
    The trucking company attributed the loss to the continued
rate of discounted in its primary markets, flat revenues and
increased costs, including uninsured claims expense resulting
from adverse weather conditions during the last three months.
    It said results outside the Northeast were strong, and it
expects to show improved results for the rest of the year.
