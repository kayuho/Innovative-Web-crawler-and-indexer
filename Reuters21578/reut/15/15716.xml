<TITLE>WASTE RECOVERY &lt;WRII&gt; IN DEAL WITH BLUE CIRCLE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DALLAS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Waste Recovery Inc said it has received
an exclusive license to use &lt;Blue Circle Industries PLC's&gt;
refuse-derived fuel technology in the U.S.
    The company said it plans to modify a 750 short ton per day
resource recovery plant in Miami to use the technology and will
sell refuse-derived fuel from the Miami plant to Lone Star
Industries Inc's &lt;LCE&gt; Hialeah, Fla., cement plant, to take the
place of about 20 pct of the Hialeah plant's coal usage.
    Waste Recovery said initial demonstration trials are
scheduled for the fourth quarter.
    Waste Recovery said it also plans to build two new scrap
tire processing plants to produce tire-derived fuel in Atlanta
and in the Philadelphia area.  It said Goodyear Tire and Rubber
Co &lt;GT&gt;, its main shareholder, has agreed to supply Waste
Recovery with scrap tires for raw materials for fuel.
    It said tire-derived fuel trials by major cement and paper
companies in the Southeast are scheduled for the second and
third quarters of 1987, with fuel for the trials to come from
its Houston plant.
