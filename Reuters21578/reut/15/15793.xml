<TITLE>BELGIAN CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS WIDENS IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Belgium's current account surplus,
measured on a cash basis, widened sharply to 134.9 billion
francs last year from 17.5 billion in 1985, the Finance
Ministry said.
    The increase was due almost entirely to a sharp rise in the
goods trade surplus to 126.1 billion francs from 20.4 billion.
    The services trade surpluses increased to 52.4 billion
francs from 38.9 billion while the deficit on transfers rose
slightly to 43.6 billion from 41.8 billion.
    Private sector capital operations showed a steeply higher
deficit of 160.7 billion francs after 56.9 billion in 1985.
