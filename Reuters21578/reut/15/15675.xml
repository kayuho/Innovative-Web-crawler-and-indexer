<TITLE>WEATHER HURTS ITALIAN ORANGES - USDA REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Unfavorable weather conditions during
the second week of March caused damage to oranges in the
Calabria region in southern Italy, the U.S. Agriculture
Department's officer in Rome said in a field report.
    The report, dated April 3, said the region accounts for
about 22,000 hectares of the Italian orange crop or about 26
pct of total production.
    However, orange production in the region for marketing year
1986/87 is forecast at 565,000 tonnes or 25 pct of the total
Italian orange crop, it said.
    The report said trade contacts agree that about 15 pct of
the orange output in Calabria was damaged by frost.
