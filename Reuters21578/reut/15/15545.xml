<TITLE>GEMINA HAS NO COMMENT ON AMBROSIANO REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Milan, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Holding company &lt;Gemina Spa&gt; said it had
no comment on an Italian press report today that it has
acquired a 12 pct stake in &lt;Nuovo Banco Ambrosiano Spa&gt;.
    Italian daily La Repubblica said that Gemina paid 205
billion lire for the shareholding from several Italian banks. A
Gemina spokeswoman told Reuters, "We have nothing to say about
the report."

Giovanni Bazoli said foreign and domestic firms have expressed
interest in buying stakes in the bank.
