<TITLE>MOODY'S MAY DOWNGRADE AMERICAN HEALTHCARE &lt;AHI&gt;</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
may downgrade American Healthcare Management Inc's 80 mln dlrs
of 15 pct subordinated notes.
    Moody's review will focus on prospects for the company's
operating earnings in view of moderately disappointing results
in 1986, an increasingly difficult industry environment and the
possible loss later this year of income from one of American
Healthcare's most profitable hospitals.
    The agency said American was unable to renew that
hospital's lease. Moody's will also study the likelihood of
American Healthcare reducing debt service requirements.
