<TITLE>COLOMBIA JAN EXPORTS UP BUT COFFEE VALUES FALL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Bogota, april 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The value of colombian exports other than
coffee rose 55 pct in january compared with the same period
last year, apparently setting a trend for the trade balance in
1987, government statistics institute figures show.
    They amounted to 180.8 mln dlrs fob compared with 147.5 mln
dlrs for coffee, a drop of 42 pct from last year.
    The trade balance registered a 35 mln dlr surplus, compared
with a 56 mln dlr surplus in january 1986.
    The national planning department forecast that in 1987
coffee, colombia's traditional major export, will account for
only one-third of total exports, or about 1.5 billion dlrs.
