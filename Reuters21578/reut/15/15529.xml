<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc &lt;RTZL.L&gt; cut its
balance sheet gearing, measured as net debt as a proportion of
equity, to 35 pct at the end of 1986 from 61 pct a year
earlier, finance director Andrew Buxton told reporters.
    He said currency movements last year did not greatly affect
the earnings outcome, though had a greater impact on the
balance sheet.
    At year-end, 40 pct of its assets were industrial, 35 pct
in metal mining and processing and 25 pct in energy.
    Earlier, RTZ reported 1986 net attributable profit of 245
