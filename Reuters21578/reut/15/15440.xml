<DATELINE>    BONN, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Shares of Continental Gummi-Werke AG
&lt;CONG.F&gt; opened eight marks stronger in an otherwise mixed
Frankfurt market and dealers attributed the trend to favourable
press reports about a new tyre system the company is
developing.
    The shares later eased to 344.50.
    A spokesman for the West German Automobile Association,
ADAC, said the ADAC magazine in a recent edition described
advantages of the new tyre.
