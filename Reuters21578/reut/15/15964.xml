<TITLE>LA LAND &lt;LLX&gt;,DU PONT &lt;DD&gt;GET EXPLORATION TRACTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW ORLEANS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Louisiana Land and Exploration Co
said it, Du Pont Co's Conoco Inc subsidiary and &lt;Oranje-Nassau
Energie B.V.&gt; have been offered four exploration blocks
offshore The Netherlands.
    Louisiana Land said Blocks Q4a, E12c and E15b were offered
to the group in which Conoco has a 67.5 pct interest, Louisiana
Land 20 pct and Orange-Nassau 12.5 pct, while this group along
with a consortium headed by Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL&gt; were offered
Block Q5c. The offers were the result of applications submitted
to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the Netherlands Sixth
Offshore Licensing Round.
    Louisiana Land said the Conoco group intends to provide a
formal acceptance of the blocks with plans to start exploration
this year.
    The company also said the two Q blocks immediately offset
other offshore blocks on which hydrocarbons have been found in
commercial quantities.
