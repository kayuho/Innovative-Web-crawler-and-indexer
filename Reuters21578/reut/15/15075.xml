<TITLE>MCI &lt;MCIC&gt; ENTERS JOINT MARKETING AGREEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATLANTA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Shared Network Technologies Inc&gt; said
it entered into a cooperative marketing agreement with MCI
Communications Corp involving services designed specifically
for the university market.
    Under the agreement, the companies will jointly promote and
support TelNet Plus, a combination of MCI's PRISM family of
services, and TelNet, Shared Network's telephone billing and
network management services, the company said.
    TelNet Plus keeps track of all calls made through a
university's telephone system, rates the calls and produces
monthly invoices for each student or departmental account,
Shared Network said.
    The system also offers a variety of reportes, which aid
college telecommunications directors in controlling and
managing their telephone systems, it added.
