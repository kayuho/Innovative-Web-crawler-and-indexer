<TITLE>CONSENSUS SEEN ON TIN PACT EXTENSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The quarterly session of the
International Tin Council (ITC) continued without formal
agreement on an extension of the sixth International Tin
Agreement (ITA), but delegates said it was apparent there was a
general consensus the Agreement should be prolonged.
    Some delegations are still awaiting formal instructions
from capitals, but informally most have indicated they favour
an extension, delegates said.
    This afternoon's session was used by delegates to seek
further clarification on some of the issues involved, and to
discuss internal matters.
    Some sources were optimistic a resolution on an extension
could be passed tomorrow but others suggested a special session
would be convened to adopt the resolution after the Association
of Tin Producing Countries meeting April 14 to 16.
    The full Council session resumes tomorrow at 1330 GMT after
a European Community coordination meeting at 1100.
