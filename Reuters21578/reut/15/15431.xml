<TITLE>BANK OF JAPAN BUYS DOLLARS IN TOKYO, DEALERS SAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan bought a modest amount
of dollars at around 145.10 yen just after the market here
opened, dealers said.
    Just before the opening, the dollar dropped swiftly as
speculators concluded the Group of Seven (G-7) comminuique
issued in Washington contained nothing basically new, they
said. It fell about a half yen, to around 145.
    The G-7 reaffirmed that their currencies around current
levels reflect economic fundamentals.
    One dealer said the Bank of Japan probably intervened in
Australia before the opening here, but could not confirm this.
