<TITLE>GERMAN INVESTMENTS ABROAD FALL IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>West Germany's total net direct investments
abroad fell to 11.2 billion marks in 1986 from 13.6 billion in
1985, but investments in developing countries rose to 683 mln
marks from 358 mln, the Economics Ministry said.
    Foreign investments in West Germany were a net 5.8 billion
marks in 1986, up from 3.6 billion in 1985, with higher
European investments largely responsible for this increase.
    The ministry noted that, despite last year's rise in West
German investments in developing countries, the 1986 level was
below the investments of over two billion marks seen in 1981,
1982 and 1983.
