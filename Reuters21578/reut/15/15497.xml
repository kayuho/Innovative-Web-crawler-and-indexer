<DATELINE>    CUPERTINO, Calif., April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Biosystems Research Inc&gt; said
its new technique for a treatment for Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome showed good results on subjects who were
treated.
    Called biostimulation, the non-drug approach to the
treatment of those with AIDS and AIDS related complex involves
exposure to low-level magnetic and electrical stimulation in
combination with phototherapy from the visible light spectrum,
the company said.

eight subjects since January 1986, for periods of five to 60
weeks. It said the treatments have not produced any adverse
