<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>(Canadian Airlines International Ltd)
said it signed an agreement with (The Flying Tiger Line Inc),
that will offer Canada's first around-the-world cargo service.
    The service, from Mirabel airport, will link Canada to a
large network of worldwide air freight markets using wide-body
B747 freighter aircraft, Canadian Airlines said.
    It said the agreement calls for the two companies to share
aircraft capacity on a 50/50 basis and compete independently
for cargo on the route.
    The airline said the joint operating agreement will give
Canadian shippers a fast, reliable and cost effective way of
moving their products to major markets, including the U.S.
