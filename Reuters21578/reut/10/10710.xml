<TITLE>BANK OF ENGLAND FORECASTS SURPLUS IN MONEY MARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it forecast a
liquidity surplus of around 100 mln stg in the money market
today.
    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, exchequer
transactions will add some 985 mln stg to the system today
while a fall in note circulation and bankers' balances above
target will add around 360 mln stg and 110 mln stg
respectively.
    Partly offsetting these inflows, bills for repurchase by
the market will drain some 785 mln stg while bills maturing in
official hands and the treasury bill take-up will remove about
546 mln stg.
