<DATELINE>    BIRMINGHAM, Mich., March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Entertainment Publications
Inc said it expects an after-tax loss of 31 cts a share in its
third quarter from the disposal of three units it closed.
    The company said its board approved a plan to discontinue
the operations of three subsidiaries, which are primarily
involved in direct mail marketing.
    "The discontinued units were not likely to meet the growth
and profit goals of the company in the future," Entertainment
Publications said.
    The three units lost 900,000 dlrs, or 19 cts a share in the
six months ended December 31.
