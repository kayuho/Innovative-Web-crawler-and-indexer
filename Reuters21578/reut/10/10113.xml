<TITLE>UAW CONFIRMS TALKS AT GM &lt;GM&gt; PLANT TO RESUME</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United Auto Workers confirmed an
earlier company statement that contract talks between striking
workers at a General Motors Corp's Michigan plant and the union
will resume at 1000 EST tomorrow.
    A UAW spokesman, in confirming a GM statement that talks
will restart, said it "remains to be seen whether the talks
will be successful."
    The union, in a statement, said it was unable to reach a
comprehensive settlement with GM on the issue of the company's
subcontracting work to non-union labor, although tentative
agreement was reached "on many matters." A UAW spokesman would
not discuss the issues involved.
    The union's 9,000 workers walked off the job at GM's
Pontiac, Mich., truck and bus works earlier today.
