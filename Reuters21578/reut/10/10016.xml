<TITLE>ROWNTREE SEEKS 200 MLN STG FACILITY, CP PROGRAM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rowntree Mackintosh Plc is seeking a 200
mln stg, five year multiple option facility, of which 150 mln
stg will be committed, and a 200 mln stg commercial paper
program, County Natwest Capital Markets Ltd said as arranger.

earlier this week, seemed to be progressing well in
