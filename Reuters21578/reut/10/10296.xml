<TITLE>NO AUSTRALIAN TREASURY NOTE TENDER NEXT WEEK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, March 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reserve Bank said it will not offer
any treasury notes for tender next week.
    Last week the Bank offered 400 mln dlrs of 13-week notes
and 100 mln dlrs of 26-week notes.
    Analysts said the Bank's decision not to offer stock next
week reflects the higher demand for funds at the start of the
system of provisional tax payments.
