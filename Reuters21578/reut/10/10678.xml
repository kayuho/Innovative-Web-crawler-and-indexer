<TITLE>SUMITOMO MINING &lt;SMIT.T&gt; RAISES NICKEL OUTPUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sumitomo Metal Mining Co said it will
raise its monthly nickel output to around 1,750 tonnes from
April 1 from 1,650 now because of increased domestic demand,
mainly from stainless steel makers.
    Sumitomo produced 1,800 tonnes of a nickel a month until
end-1986, but cut output in January because of stagnant demand,
a company official said.
    Calendar 1987 production is likely to fall to around 20,000
tonnes from 22,000 in 1986 as a result of the first quarter
reduction, he said.
    Sumitomo is Japan's only nickel producer.
