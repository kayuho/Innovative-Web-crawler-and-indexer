<TITLE>FORMER HERSTATT DEALER CAN BE SUED, COURT RULES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KASSEL, West Germany, March 26- </DATELINE><BODY>The former chief currency
dealer of Herstatt Bank, which collapsed in 1974 on foreign
exchange speculation in West Germany's biggest banking crash,
can stand trial for damages, a court ruled.
    The court overturned a claim by Danny Dattel that a case
for damages should not be allowed after such a long interval.
    Herstatt creditors are seeking 12.5 mln marks from Dattel,
whom they accuse of causing losses at the bank of over 500 mln
marks by manipulating forward foreign exchange contracts.
    The crash of the private Herstatt bank with losses of over
one billion marks stunned West Germany's business community,
and led to a tightening of banking regulations.
    The losses were even greater than the 480 mln marks
announced recently by Volkswagen as a result of fraud in
currency transactions.
    Ivan Herstatt, managing director of the bank when it
collapsed, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison in
1984 but appealed. Six other people associated with the bank
were jailed in 1983.
    But Dattel was freed from prosecution after he produced
medical evidence of paranoia caused by Nazi persecution during
his childhood, which might have led him to take his own life.
