<TITLE>DECISION INDUSTRIES &lt;DIC&gt; SEES 1ST QTR LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HORSHAM, Penn., March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Decision Industries Corp said it
expects to report an operating loss of 19-24 cts a share for
the first quarter ending March 31 mainly due to lower profit
margins and higher sales and marketing costs.
    In the 1st quarter of last year, when the company's quarter
ended Feb 28, 1986, it earned 957,000 dlrs or 10 cts a share on
revenues of 45 mln dlrs.
    Decision also said it entered into an agreement to sell its
International Computerized Telemarketing Inc subsidiary to an
investor group headed by the unit's senior management. Terms
were not disclosed.
    Decision also said it consolidated its Decision Development
Corp subsidiary into Decision Data Computer Corp, the unit
which designs, manufactures and sells its System/3X peripheral
products.
    It said this restructuring will adversely affect its first
quarter earnings, but it said it expects to realize a
"significant savings" in operating expenses through the
remainder of the year.
