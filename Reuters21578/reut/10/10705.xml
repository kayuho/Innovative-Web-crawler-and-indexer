<TITLE>JAPAN BUYS LARGE AMOUNT OF BRAZILIAN SOYBEANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese crushers have bought some
214,000 tonnes of Brazilian soybeans for late April/early July
shipment and may buy up to 140,000 to 190,000 tonnes more for
June to August shipment, trade sources said.
    Japan imported 128,089 tonnes of Brazilian beans in
calendar 1986, Finance Ministry customs-cleared statistics
show.
    The sources said Brazilian beans were cheaper than U.S.
Origin which may account for the heavy purchases, but added
there were concerns about deliveries from Brazil in the near
term due to labour problems there.
    The Japanese purchases comprise 30,000 tonnes for April
20/May 10 shipment, 102,000 for May, 15,000 for late May/early
June, 36,000 for June, and 31,000 for late June/early July
shipment, the sources said.
    As a result of the large volumes of Brazilian beans
purchased, Japanese crushers will buy a total of only 150,000
tonnes of U.S. Beans for May shipment. Some 100,000 of this
shipment has already been purchased, the sources added.
    They said crushers bought some 270,000 to 280,000 tonnes of
U.S. Beans for April shipment.
