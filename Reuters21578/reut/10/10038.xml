<TITLE>(CORRECTED) - MOBIL &lt;MOB&gt; TO UPGRADE REFINERY UNIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mobil Corp said it will spend over 30
mln dlrs to upgrade a gasoline-producing unit at its Beaumont,
Texas, refinery.
    It said the unit is a catalytic reformer, which converts
low-octane components of gasoline into high-octane components
for use in Super Unleaded gasoline.
    The company said the modernization will allow the unit to
regenerate catalysts on a continuous basis without shutdown.
Currently, it must be shut twice a year.  The unit produces
46,000 barrels of gasoline components a day.  Construction will
start late this year, with completion set for mid-1989.
