<TITLE>FCC EASES RULE FOR CABLE TV FIRMS ON SWITCH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Communications
Commission voted at a meeting to ease a requirement that cable
television firms must provide a signal-selector switch free of
charge to all customers.
    The so-called A/B switch is attached to a television set
and permits a viewer to turn from cable programs to
over-the-air broadcast stations which cable companies must
carry.
    After the rule was criticized the FCC changed it so that
cable firms would have to provide the switch only if a customer
requested it and could charge a fee.
