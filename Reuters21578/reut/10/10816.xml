<TITLE>CANADIAN WORLDWIDE ENERGY BUYS TRITON&lt;OIL&gt; UNIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CALGARY, Alberta, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Canadian Worldwide Energy
Ltd&gt; said it acquired Triton Energy Corp's wholly owned
Canadian subsidiary, Triton Petroleum Ltd, for the issue of
3.75 mln common shares of Canadian Worldwide, subject to
regulatory approvals.
    The company said the transaction will increase Triton
Energy's holding in Canadian Worldwide to 13.25 mln shrs or a
60 pct fully diluted interest from 9.5 mln shares.
    Triton Petroleum's assets consist of proven oil reserves of
1.3 mln barrels, exploratory acreage, and unspecified working
capital and a significant tax loss carryforward.
    Canadian Worldwide said it is optimistic the Triton
Petroleum Ltd acquisition will strengthen its financial and
production base and permit acceleration of its conventional oil
exploration program.
