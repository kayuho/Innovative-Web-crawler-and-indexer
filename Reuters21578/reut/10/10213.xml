<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chicago real estate developer
Leonard Chavin told the Securities and Exchange Commission he
had raised his stake in the L.E. Meyers Co Group to 11 pct from
9.7 pct.
    He also said an investment banker repesenting him met with
Myers' officers, telling them of his plans for a takeover and
that he may solicit proxies for a seat on Myers' board.
    Chavin also said if he takes control of the firm, it could
result in delisting Meyers' from the New York Stock Exchange.
    He told the SEC that while he is trying to buy or acquire
the firm, he still may only hold the shares for an investment.
