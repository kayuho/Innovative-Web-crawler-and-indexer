<TITLE>DOW &lt;DOW&gt; SEES RECORD ANNUAL PROFITS IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dow Chemical Co believes strong margins
for chemical products could result in record earnings this
year, Chairman Paul Oreffice said.
    "I'm hoping we will have the best year in our history
profit-wise," he told reporters following a speech at The
American Institute of Chemical Engineers meeting.
    "I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a
record year, or close to it," Oreffice said.
    In 1986, Dow earned 741 mln dlrs an increase from 1985's 58
mln dlrs brought about by falling oil prices and resulting
cheaper feedstock costs.
    Oreffice also said Dow's profit margins on chemical
products would improve this year over last year.
    He said reduced capacity in the chemical industry and the
weakened U.S. dollar would also contribute to the company's
improved performance.
    Dow will spending about 650 mln dlrs on research and
development in 1987 with an emphasis on new specialty
chemicals, Oreffice said.
