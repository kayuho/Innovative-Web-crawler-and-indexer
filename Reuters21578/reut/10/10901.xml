<TITLE>NOBEL'S BOFORS TO SELL ITS SINGAPORE HOLDING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nobel Industries Sweden SA &lt;NOBL.ST&gt;
said its arms subsidiary, &lt;AB Bofors&gt;, plans to sell its 40 pct
stake in &lt;Allied Ordnance Co of Singapore Ltd&gt; because of its
part in weapons exports which contravene Swedish law.
    "The events we have uncovered are unacceptable and highly
regrettable incidents in our company's history," Nobel chairman
Lars-Erik Thunholm told a news conference.
    Nobel managing director Anders Carlberg said an internal
inquiry has revealed an extensive network of international arms
smuggling.
