<TITLE>U.S. BANKER PREDICTS FURTHER DOLLAR FALL THIS YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ABU DHABI, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>A leading U.S. Banker said the dollar
was likely to fall another five to 10 pct this year and an
improvement in the huge American trade deficit would be only
temporary at current world exchange rate levels.
    Kurt Viermetz, worldwide treasurer of Morgan Guaranty Trust
Co, told Arab currency traders meeting here that the steady
depreciation of the dollar had not gone far enough to rein in
U.S. deficits on a lasting basis.
