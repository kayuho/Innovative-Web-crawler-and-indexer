<TITLE>BUNDESBANK BOUGHT DOLLARS AGAINST YEN, DEALERS SAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank entered the open
market in the late morning to buy dollars against yen in
concert with the Bank of France, dealers said.
    The Bundesbank came into the market when the dollar was
around 148.10 yen just after it had fallen below 148 to touch
147.80 at 1027 GMT. The move had little effect, with the dollar
still testing 148 yen ahead of the official fixing.
    Dealers said the intervention was for fairly small amounts,
in contrast to the Bundesbank's activity on Wednesday when
dealers reported it bought about 100 mln dlrs.
    The Bundesbank had no comment.
