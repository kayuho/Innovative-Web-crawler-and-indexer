<TITLE>YUGOSLAVIA TO HELP PRODUCE NEW SOVIET AIRLINER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BELGRADE, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Yugoslavia said it has been asked to
participate in the production of a new Soviet airliner -- the
Ilyushin 114.
    The official Tanjug news agency said this was decided at a
meeting in Havana of officials of the Soviet-led trade group
Comecon. Yugoslavia is a communist nonaligned state, belonging
neither to the Warsaw Pact or the Western alliance, Nato, but
it enjoys preferential trading status in Comecon.  Under the
deal, Yugoslavia will produce several major parts, including
the landing gear, for the new medium-range 80-passenger
Ilyushin airliner, Tanjug said. No financial details were
disclosed.
