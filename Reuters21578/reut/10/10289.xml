<TITLE>SOUTH KOREA PLANS 11-12 PCT BUDGET RISE IN 1988</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, March 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea plans to increase the size of
its budget in 1988 by 11 to 12 pct from this year's 15,596
billion won, Economic Planning Board officials said.
    The proposed boost is based on a government forecast that
gross national product (gnp) will grow by more than 7.5 pct and
the gnp deflator by 3.5 pct in 1988, against targets of 8.0 pct
and 3.5 pct respectively this year, they said.
    Details of the 1988 budget, in which spending will match
revenue, have yet to be worked out, the officials said.
    The balanced budget in 1986 totalled 13,800.5 billion won.
