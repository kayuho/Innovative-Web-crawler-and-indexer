<TITLE>PRU BACHE ANALYST REAFFIRMS BULLISH MARKET CALL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Joseph Feshbach, chief market analyst
at Prudential-Bache Securities, said the stock market is poised
to climb above Dow Jones Industrial 2500 level by June.
    The Dow average is around 2380 today.
    "Liquidity is the biggest fundamental factor in the market
and money coming out of fixed income funds and flowing into
equities will propel the market sharply higher," Feshbach said,
noting that the market's peak will occur in June.
    Feshbach said that in early January he predicted that the
Dow Jones Industrial average, the most closely watched market
barometer, would reach the 2400 level by April and the 2500
level by June. He said he is now even more optimistic, saying
"the market is ready for a 150 point rise from current levels
any day now."
