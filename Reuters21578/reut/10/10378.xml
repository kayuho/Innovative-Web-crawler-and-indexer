<TITLE>SOUTH AFRICAN RESERVE BANK SEES INFLATION DROP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PRETORIA, March 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Africa's inflation rate,
currently at 16.3 pct, should decline further during 1987, the
Reserve Bank said in its latest quarterly review.
    Although the recent fall in inflation was "largely
attributable to purely statistical factors," the decline had
clearly been aided by a recovery in the rand's exchange rate,
the Bank said.
    "The inflation rate stands to benefit further from the more
recent advances in the exchange rate in the third quarter of
1986 and in the first few months of 1987," it said.
