<TITLE>JAPAN VTR PRODUCTION FALLS IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's video tape recorder (VTR)
production fell 10.4 pct from a year earlier to 2.18 mln sets
in February for the third successive year-on-year drop,
reflecting slow exports, the Electronic Industries Association
of Japan said.
    But February output was up 27.2 pct from a month earlier.
    Colour television production rose 5.7 pct from a year
earlier to 1.20 mln sets in February after 15 consecutive
year-on-year drops. The February increase over a year ago
reflected higher domestic sales. The production was up 38.5 pct
from a month earlier.
