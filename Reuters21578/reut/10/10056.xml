<TITLE>TRINITY INDUSTRIES &lt;TRN&gt; AND UNIT CUT BY S/P</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it cut
to BB-minus from BB-plus Trinity Industries Inc's 275 mln dlrs
of liquid yield option notes.
    Also downgraded were the unit Trinity Industries Leasing
Co's 60 mln dlrs of convertible debentures due 2006 to BB-plus
from BBB-minus.
    S and P said the actions reflected Trinity's weakened
earnings due to depressed demand in several key markets, the
likelihood that a significant sustained improvement would not
occur in the near-term, as well as heightened financial risk
from a series of debt-financed acquisitions.
