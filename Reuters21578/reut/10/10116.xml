<TITLE>SMITH BARNEY CUTS RATING ON MCGRAW-HILL &lt;MHP&gt;</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co
analyst Edward Atorino lowered his rating on McGraw-Hill Inc
from a strong buy to a buy, saying earnings this year will be a
little less than he previously expected.
    McGraw Hill fell 2-1/4 to 68-1/4 on 223,000 shares.
    Atorino said his decision reflected mainly non-operating
factors and a recent gain in the share price. He said after
several acquisitions last year good will charges are up. Also,
the company faces a higher tax rate.
    Atorino expects earnings of 3.55 dlrs per share this year,
up from 3.04 dlrs last year.
