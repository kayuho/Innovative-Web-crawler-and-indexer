<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>The 50-day provisional 1987/88 budget,
adopted today by the government, allows the Finance Ministry to
issue up to 14,600 billion yen worth of foreign exchange fund

to buy dollars, to prevent a further dollar fall.

50 days of the year starting April 1, accounts for more than 90
pct of the 16,000 billion yen in bills incorporated in the full
budget.
