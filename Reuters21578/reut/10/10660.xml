<TITLE>DLR FALLS ON FEAR TOKYO WON'T HIKE DEMAND-MIYAZAWA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said
that the dollar's drop today to 145 yen is partly attributable
to the perception inside and outside Japan that the country has
failed to fulfill its promise to expand domestic demand.
    He told a Lower House budget committee in Parliament that
it was natural for other nations to think that Japan is not
doing enough because of the delay in the passage of the 1987/88
budget.
    The budget has been delayed by opposition boycotts of
Parliament to protest government plans for a new sales tax.
