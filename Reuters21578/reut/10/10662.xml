<TITLE>PERU SAYS NEW GOLD DEPOSITS WORTH 1.3 BILLION DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LIMA, March 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Alan Garcia said Peru has found
gold deposits worth an estimated 1.3 billion dlrs in a jungle
region near the Ecuadorean border about 1,000 km north of here.
    He told reporters the deposits, located at four sites near
the town of San Ignasio, contained the equivalent of 100 tonnes
of gold.
    Garcia said the government would soon install a two mln dlr
treatment plant at Tomaque. It will extract enough ore to
provide an estimated 25 mln dlr profit by the end of this year,
he added.
    Garcia said the other gold-bearing deposits are located at
Tamborapa, Pachapidiana and a zone between the Cenepa and
Santiago rivers.
