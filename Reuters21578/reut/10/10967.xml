<TITLE>U.S. REPLACING ALL MARINE SECURITY GUARDS IN MOSCOW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States said it was
replacing all 28 Marine security guards at its embassy in
Moscow after two who were stationed there were arrested on
spying charges.
    Deputy State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the
Marines would be rotated back to the United States by the end
of April to facilitate a three-pronged government investigation
now underway.
    She told reporters the move -- replacing an entire marine
security guard contingent -- was unprecedented.
