<TITLE>EC COMMISSIONER WELCOMES COCOA ACCORD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>The new International Cocoa Agreement
should lead to a stabilisation of prices, both benefitting
producer countries and promoting an equilibrium in
international economic relations, European Community
Development Commissioner Lorenzo Natali said.
    He said in a statement welcoming the agreement on buffer
stock rules reached last week in London that it resulted in
large part from initiatives taken by the EC Commission after
consumers and producers had reached deadlock in initial
negotiations.
