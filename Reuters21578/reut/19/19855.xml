International Inc said it has completed two additional
geothermal wells in its steam fields in The Geysers area of
northern California.
    The field is being developed to supply steam to the
130-megawatt Coldwater Creek Geothermal Power Plant, scheduled
to go into commercial operation in late 1987 or early 1988, the
company said, adding it has completed 15 geothermal wells in
the field since 1981.
    The Coldwater Creek power plant is being built by a
consortium of local utilities, Geothermal said.
