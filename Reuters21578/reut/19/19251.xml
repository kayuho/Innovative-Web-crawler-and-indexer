<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
affirmed First Wisconsin Corp's 50 mln dlrs of debt.
    Affirmed were the firm's Baa-1 senior debt and Baa-2
preferred stock.
    Moody's noted that First Wisconsin said it would add a
special loan loss provision of 96 mln dlrs to reflect exposure
to economically troubled international borrowers. The provision
