<TITLE>EC FARM MINISTERS TO MEET TOMORROW AFTER SUMMIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community agriculture
ministers will meet tomorrow evening, after the end of a
two-day summit meeting of heads of government, to again attempt
to agree a 1987/88 farm price package, an EC Commission
spokesman said.
    He added that tomorrow's EC Official Journal will contain
notice of special agricultural measures of a purely technical
nature which will come into effect on July 1 unless the
ministers reach an accord.
    The spokesman declined to detail these special measures but
said they would not be the sort of "dynamic" moves which EC Farm
Commissioner Frans Andriessen has said he would take in the
case of complete deadlock among farm ministers.
    These moves would be taken only if tomorrow's meeting of
ministers in Brussels again fails to reach an accord, EC
sources said.
    Andriessen is thought to be prepared to cut cereals prices
by seven pct and to take other drastic action, trade sources
said.
    EC farm ministers ended their last meeting on June 18 still
split over the Commission's proposal for a tax on vegetable and
marine oils and fats.
    In addition, West Germany said it would veto plans for
cereal price cuts and for a change in the green currency
system.
    Earlier today, diplomats said Belgium, the current holder
of the European Community presidency, appears ready to drop the
plans for the controversial oils and fats tax.
