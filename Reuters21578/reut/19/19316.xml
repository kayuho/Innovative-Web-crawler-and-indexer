<TITLE>CANADIAN CHEMICAL PRODUCERS SET TRANSPORT CODE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JASPER, Alberta, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The 72-member Canadian Chemical
Producers Association said it adopted a code of practice for
the safe transport of chemicals and their by-products.
    "Through cooperation with the transportation industry, we
will not only minimize transportation accidents but also the
risks to people and the environment," association president
David Buzzelli said at the annual meeting in Jasper.
    He said as a first step the association will conduct an
internal survey rating the safety capabilities of trucking
companies that transport chemicals.
