<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Tri-Star Pictures Inc said it won
permanent relief from various provisions of the 1952 Consent
Judgment and 1980 Order that apply to the Loews' Theatre
Circuit, which Tri-Star acquired last December.
    It said the U.S. District Court for the Southern District

pictures in loews theaters and to allow Tri-Star to conduct its
business other than with Loews free from restructions of the
court's earlier orders.
