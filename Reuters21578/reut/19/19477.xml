<TITLE>NO COMINCO STRIKE TALKS SCHEDULED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TRAIL, British Columbia, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cominco Ltd said no
talks were scheduled with striking workers at its Trail smelter
and Kimberley, British Columbia lead-zinc mine.
    A company spokesman said the company and union met
informally Tuesday but talks did not constitute a formal
bargaining session. The last formal talks were on June 5.
    The workers went on strike May 9 and production has been
shut down since then.
    The Trail smelter produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and
110,000 long tons of lead last year. The Sullivan mine at
Kimberley produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore in 1986, most for
processing at the Trail smelter.
