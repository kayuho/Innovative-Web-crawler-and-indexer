<TITLE>REED SAYS IT HAS NO COMMENT ON HARCOURT RUMOURS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Reed International Plc &lt;REED.L&gt; said it
had no comment to make on U.K. stock market rumors that
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc &lt;HBJ&gt; may make a bid for the
company in order to escape unwelcome offers from Robert
Maxwell's British Printing and Communication Corp &lt;BPCL.L&gt;.
    A spokeswoman for Reed said earlier analysts forecasts that
a bid for Reed will have to be about 700 mln stg were totally
unrealistic, adding that its current market is about 2.7
billion stg.
