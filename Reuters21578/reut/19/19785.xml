<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Michael Wilson announced
amendments to Canada's revolving standby credit facility with a
group of Canadian banks to provide more favorable terms

options.
    The size of the facility has also been reduced to three
billion dlrs U.S. from 3.5 billion dlrs U.S. The maturity
