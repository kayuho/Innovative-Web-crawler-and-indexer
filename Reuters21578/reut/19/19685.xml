<TITLE>CHRYSLER &lt;C&gt; REPORTED TO BE IN TALKS WITH CHINA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chrysler Corp is negotiating with the
Chinese Government owned First Autoworks about a project in
which the Dodge 600 mid-sized car could be added to the Chinese
firm's lineup, the trade paper Automotive News said.
    It said Chrysler is discussing the supply of 2.2 liter
four-cylinder engines as well as tooling for the 600, which has
been on the U.S. market since 1982.
    Chrysler spokesmen were not available for comment today.
But the trade paper quoted an unnamed spokesman as saying
Chrysler is competing with French-based Citroen and an unnamed
Japanese maker to supply First Autoworks.
