<TITLE>BRAZIL RULING PARTY TO DECIDE ON PRESIDENTIAL TERM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRASILIA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The ruling Brazilian Democratic
Movement Party (PMDB) will hold a national convention on July
18 and 19 to discuss the length of the Presidential term, a
PMDB spokesman said.
    Although the country's constitution allows for a six-year
term, Sarney said he would remain only five years after he came
to power in 1984.
    The Constituent Assembly is drawing up a new constitution
and severe economic problems have increased the pressure on it
to call early elections. A faction of the PMDB favours a poll
in November next year.
