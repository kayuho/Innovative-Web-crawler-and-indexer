<TITLE>C. ITOH SEES NO GROWTH IN 1987/88 GROUP PROFIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>C. Itoh and Co Ltd &lt;CITT.T&gt; said its group
net profit in the year ending March 31, 1988, is expected to be
unchanged from a year earlier.
    The prediction assumes a yen/dollar rate of 140 yen and a
crude oil price of 18 dlrs a barrel, a company spokesman told
Reuters. Sales in 1987/88 are estimated at 15,100 billion yen,
up 2.3 pct from a year earlier.
    The company earlier reported group net profit of 20.07
billion yen in the year ended March 31, 1987, up 8.6 pct from a
year earlier, helped by a drop in sales and administration
costs and reduced interest charges.
