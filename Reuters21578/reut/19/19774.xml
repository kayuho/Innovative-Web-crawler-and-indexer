<TITLE>SUNRIVER INTRODUCES NEW WORKSTATIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;SunRiver Corp&gt;, a Jackson, Miss.-based
computer products company, said it introduced the first line of
computer workstations designed to be connected with powerful
personal computers over fiber-optic cable.
    The privately held company said up to 16 of its new Cygna
386 workstations can attach to a PC based on Intel Corp's
&lt;INTC.O&gt; 80386 microprocessor, which include models sold by
Compaq Computer Corp &lt;CPQ&gt; and International Business Machines
Corp &lt;IBM&gt;.
    SunRiver said the Cygna workstations allow users to access
files and share printers and other equipment controlled by an
80386-based PC.
    In addition, the workstations are the first of their kind
to offer full graphics capabilities in a multiuser-multitasking
environment, Sunriver said.
    The company said the Cygna line will be available in
October at prices starting at 1,599 dlrs.
