<TITLE>PHILIPS SEES BOOM IN MINI VISUAL DISPLAY BUSINESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    EINDHOVEN, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The market for advanced visual
displays will grow seven-fold into a five billion dlr business
in five years, NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken &lt;PGLO.AS&gt; said.
    Philips is Europe's largest supplier of liquid crystal
displays (LCDs) currently used in lighter and more efficient
televisions and screens.
    Last year, the market was worth 683 mln dlrs. But Philips
sees a surge in demand with applications in monitors, test and
measuring equipment, cars and telecommunications equipment.
    Philips said the overall market value will have risen to
five billion dlrs by 1992.
    It has so far used LCDs only in industrial applications,
but said in a statement it was moving to get a big share of a
growing consumer products market.
    Pocket-sized LCDS are already produced and marketed by
Japanese manufacturers and sell at around 100 to 200 dlrs,
Philips spokesman Jack Reemers said.
    Philips hopes to launch its version later this year.
