<TITLE>WAREHOUSE CLUB &lt;WCLB.O&gt; MAY LOWER RESERVES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Warehouse Club Inc said it subleased two
Chicago locations closed in April and is reviewing the five mln
dlr second quarter reserve established to cover the cost of the
closures.
    The company told Reuters it will probably remove two to
three mln dlrs of the total reserve amount which will result in
higher third quarter profits.
    In the 1986 quarter, Warehouse Club had net loss of 891,000
dlrs or 13 cents a share on sales of 41.4 mln dlrs.
    The company said it will achieve a profit in the third
quarter despite any reduction in the reserve.
