<TITLE>LEBANESE BANK STAFF STRIKE OVER MISSING COLLEAGUES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BEIRUT, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lebanese bank employees went on a one-day
strike to draw attention to the fate of three Central Bank
colleagues missing, believed kidnapped, since 1985.
    The strike, which shut the foreign exchange market and
banks across the country, was called by the Central Bank
Employees' Union and the Bankers' Association, which groups
more than 80 Lebanese banks.
    The three missing Christian employees are believed to have
been kidnapped while crossing from Christian East Beirut to
Moslem West Beirut nearly two years ago.
