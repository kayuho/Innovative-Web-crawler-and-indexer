<TITLE>LATIN, CARIBBEAN NATIONS OPPOSE TRADE BILLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>A group of Latin American and
Caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in
Congress, saying it would curb their exports, slow development
and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt.
    Mario Rodriguez Montero, president of an Organization of
American States special committee on trade, said he was aware
of the large U.S. trade deficit, but added "the region should
not be the one affected by the trade bills."
    He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar
and the budget deficit, and "it is regrettable to solve it by a
trade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests."
    Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two
days of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now in
Congress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit,
which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs.
    Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at
Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large,
annual trade surpluses with the United States.
    Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations
with large trade surpluses last year with the United States,
but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2
billion dlrs, against Japan's of 58.6 billion dlrs.
    The European Community has also opposed the bills.
    Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the
Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in
the legislation, including those to curb imports and to require
retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices.
    He told reporters the committee would likely mount a
campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate
on the Senate floor, expected next week.
    Rodriguez said "the region needs trade to continue
development.  We hope this need will not be affected negatively
by trade legislation."
    Rodriguez said: "we need to keep the market opens -
especially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreign
exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue
national development progress."
    President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he
termed "protectionist," and his aides now are mounting a effort
to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the
legislation.
    Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto, Rodriguez
said as yet "the administration is not in a veto frame of mind."
