<TITLE>SUPERTANKERS ANCHOR OFF BAHRAIN AFTER ATTACKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Two supertankers attacked in the Gulf by
Iranian gunboats on Saturday have anchored off Bahrain for
damage inspection, shipping sources said.
    The 224,607 tonne Norwegian ship Mia Margrethe and the
Liberian-registered Stena Concordia, 273,616 tonnes, both came
under fire off the Saudi Arabian coastline.
    Agents for the tankers in Bahrain told Reuters the extent
of damage had not yet been estimated.
    Both ships will be inspected in Bahrain and may be repaired
by the Arab Shipbuilding and Repair Yard Co.
    The U.S. Frigate Stark, damaged last month in an Iraqi air
attack in the Gulf, left Bahrain early on Sunday and anchored
four miles off shore. The vessel is due to return shortly to
the U.S. for further repairs.
