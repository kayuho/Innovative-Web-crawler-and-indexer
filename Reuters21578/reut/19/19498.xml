<TITLE>NBC WRITERS, PRODUCERS AND TECHNICIANS ON STRIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Producers, news writers, editors and
technicians began a strike at the National Broadcasting Co
(NBC), leaving management employees to do their jobs.
    The strike by members of the National Association of
Broadcast Employees (NABET), representing 2,800 of NBC's 8,000
workers, began at 12:01 A.M. (0401 GMT) after the network
imposed a contract which the union said was unacceptable.
    The union said its main objection to the contract was that
it permitted NBC to employ additional part-time workers.
    The average salary of workers represented by NABET is
65,000 dlrs a year.
    Union officials said management was being intransigent and
blamed General Electric &lt;GE&gt;, which purchased NBC and its
parent company RCA in 1985 in a flurry of communications
company takeovers.
    The strike is the first for NBC since 1976.
    The two sides said they have set no time to meet again.
