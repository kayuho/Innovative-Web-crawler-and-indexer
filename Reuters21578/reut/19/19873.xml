<TITLE>FIRST PENNSYLVANIA &lt;FBA&gt; TO LAUNCH NEW VISA CARD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PHILADELPHIA, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>First Pennsylvania Bank N.A., the
major subsidiary of First Pennsylvania Corp, said it will add a
variable-rate &lt;VISA&gt; card to its consumer credit product line.
    The bank said the card carries a 14 pct annual interest
rate that is guaranteed through Sept 30, after which time the
interest rate will increase or decrease if there is a change in
the prime rate as reflected in the Wall Street Journal.
    There is no grace period for purchases made with card, but
First Pennsylvania already offers a &lt;MasterCard&gt; product with a
25-day grace period, the bank added.
