<TITLE>ARIZONA NUCLEAR PLANT SHUTDOWN DUE TO WATER LEAK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WINTERSBURG, Ariz., June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Palo Verde Unit 1 nuclear
power plant was removed from service Sunday due to a leaking
pipe in its circulating water system, according to the plant's
operator, the Arizona Nuclear Power Project.
    It said the pipe, on the non-nuclear, steam-generating side
of the plant, delivers water to the plant's condenser. This
water is used to condense steam to drive the turbine generator,
the Power Project said.
    The cause of the leak is being investigated and no time
estimate was given for when the unit will return to service, it
said, adding Unit 2 is operating at full power.
    The Arizona Nuclear Power Project is a consortium of
southwest U.S. utilities including AZP Group's &lt;AZP&gt; Arizona
Public Service, El Paso Electric &lt;ELPA&gt;, Public Service of New
Mexico &lt;PNM&gt; and Southern California Edison &lt;SCE&gt;.
