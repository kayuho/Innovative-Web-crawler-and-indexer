<TITLE>STERIVET &lt;STVTF.O&gt; HAS FDA REVIEW STATUS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sterivet Laboratories Ltd said the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration granted expedited review status
for its proprietary drug Navicon.
    The company said future marketability of Navicon in the
U.S. will be greatly facilitated by receiving expedited review
status and the company should achieve wide penetration once FDA
approval for the drug is received.
    Navicon is a drug designed to treat navicular disease which
affects the feet of one-third of all horses aged between five
and 15.
