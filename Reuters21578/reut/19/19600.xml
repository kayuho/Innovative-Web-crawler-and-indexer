<TITLE>EC LEADERS BEGIN BRUSSELS SUMMIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Leaders of the European Community (EC)
began their two-day summit, with reform of the group's creaking
finances heading the agenda, officials said.
    The 12 government leaders were joined by French President
Mitterrand and their foreign ministers.
    The twice-yearly meeting will also examine some world
issues, especially the Middle East, but diplomats said the
group's cash crisis would dominate the talks.
