<TITLE>SPAIN CARGO FIRMS HIRE DOCKERS TO OFFSET STRIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BARCELONA, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cargo handling companies said they
were hiring twice the usual number of dockers to offset an
intermittent strike in Spanish ports.
    Spanish dockers began a nine-day strike on Wednesday in
which they only work alternate hours in protest at government
plans to partially privatize port services.
