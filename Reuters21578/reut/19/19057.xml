<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The joint committee of Taiwan's soybean
importers awarded a contract to Cargill Inc of Minneapolis,
Minnesota, for supply of one 32,000 tonne cargo of U.S.
Soybeans, a committee spokesman told Reuters.
    The cargo, priced at 249.10 U.S. Dlrs per tonne c and f
Taiwan, is set for delivery before July 7, he said.
    The committee cancelled a tender for another cargo because
the prices offered by U.S. Suppliers were too high, he added.
