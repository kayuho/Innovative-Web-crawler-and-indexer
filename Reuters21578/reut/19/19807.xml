<TITLE>DAUSTER SAYS CONSUMERS SHOULD KEEP OUT OF QUOTAS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MEDELLIN, Colombia, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Consumer countries should not
intervene in the distribution of coffee export quotas,
Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster said.
    "Distribution of export quotas should be in the hands of
producers as has been traditional," Dauster, a delegate at the
recent coffee symposium here, told journalists. "When consumers
want to get involved, talks are much more difficult."
    The main consumer country the United States and main
producer Brazil failed to reach agreement on quota distribution
when the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) met in
February.
    Dauster said Brazil's role when the ICO meets in London in
September will be to support the world coffee pact, defend its
market share and argue for distribution of quotas to be in the
hands of producer countries.
    "We have sacrificed a great deal already," he said. "this year
we have a crop of 35 mln bags, we have economic problems and we
are not in a position to do favours."
