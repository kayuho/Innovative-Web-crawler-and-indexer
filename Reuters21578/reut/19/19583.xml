<TITLE>THOUSANDS TRAPPED IN BANGLADESH FLASH FLOODS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DHAKA, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Flash floods and high winds have trapped
some 10,000 people and injured at least 50 in northeastern
Bangladesh's Sunamganj district, officials said.
    They said water, knee-deep in at least 10 villages
following heavy rains last Wednesday, was receding after
extensively damaging crops and property.
    The situation was aggravated by a 40-mile-per-hour storm
which swept across the area yesterday and flattened at least
200 houses, the officials said but gave no other details.
    Relief Ministry officials, describing the floods as a
"routine hazard," told Reuters relief squads had been dispatched
to the area with food and medicine.
