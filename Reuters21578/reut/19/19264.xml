unit said it will offer 300 mln dlrs in certificates
representing interests in a pool of receivables selected from
its California Classic Visa credit card accounts.
    The certificate rate is 8.2 pct. The offering price to the
public is 99.89 dlrs, resulting in a yield to certificate
holdes of 8.21 pct.

lettter of credit by Bayerische Vereinsbank AG, BankAmerica

and maintain customer relationships, while the proceeds of the
offering can be used to fund new loans.

home loans sold as mortgage pass-through certificates.
