<TITLE>APOLLO &lt;APCI.O&gt; LICENSES PHOENIX SOFTWARE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NORWOOD, Mass, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Phoenix Technologies Ltd&gt; said it
has signed a marketing agreement with Apollo Computer Inc.
    Phoenix said that the agreement allows Apollo to market
Phoenix's software under the name "Domain/PC Emulator."
    The company said that the software will be available on
Apollo's new Domain Series 4000 personal workstations and
Apollo's current generation of machines by the end of this
year's third quarter.
    Phoenix said the software allows system manufacturers to
offer their customers an MS-DOS based 100 pct PC-compatible
operating mode, done solely through software emulation.
    Apollo will license the software from Phoenix and sell it
directly to its customers.
