<TITLE>SAFEWAY AGREES TO SEVERANCE FOR DALLAS WORKERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United Food and Commercial
Workers Union said unlisted Safeway Inc has agreed to provide
severance pay to about 5,000 workers in the Dallas area
resulting from the closure of a division last April.
    The union said the total severance payment will be about
five mln dlrs. It said the division was closed as a result of
4.6 billion dlrs in debt incurred from a leveraged buyout last
year.
    The union said it filed suit following the leveraged buyout
to protect the claims of union members.
    The leveraged buyout was implemented to ward off a bid by
Dart Group Corp &lt;DARTA.O&gt;.
