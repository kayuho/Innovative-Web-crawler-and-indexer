<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The World Bank said it approved a 70
mln dlr loan to Hungary to help finance a 833.1 mln dlr
telecommunications project.
    The Bank noted that Hungary, which until recently had given
telecommunications low priority, recognized that inadequate
telecommunications are a serious constraint to economic
development and reform.
    The project extends through 1991 and will help Magyar
Posta, the state enterprise overseeing the telecommunications
sector, meet its long-term development goals.
