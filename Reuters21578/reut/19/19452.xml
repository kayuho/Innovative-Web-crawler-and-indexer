<TITLE>WISCONSIN POWER &lt;WPC&gt; REPORTS RADIATION LEAK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MILWAUKEE, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Wisconsin Electric Power Co said a
small amount of slightly radioactive water was released from
its Point Beach Nuclear Plant at Two Creeks, Wis.
    The company said 235 gallons of cooling water were released
into Lake Michigan this morning as plant employees accidentally
opened a valve while cleaning a holding tank.
    The company said the radioactive water was heavily diluted
and that it expects "no environmental or public health or
safety impact as a result of this discharge."
    Preliminary tests of lake samples detected no increase in
lake water radioactivity, it said.
