<TITLE>DAYTON HUDSON &lt;DH&gt; NOT INTERESTED IN ACQUISITION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dayton Hudson Corp, in a
letter to employees, said it told an "aggressive buyer" of the
company's stock that it does not want to be acquired.
    A Dayton Hudson spokeswoman would not identify the buyer,
but Wall Street sources said Dart Group Corp &lt;DARTA.O&gt; was the
company interested in buying Dayton Hudson stock.
    The Wall Street sources said the Dart Group is expected
soon to file a statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on its accumulation of Dayton Hudson stock.
    According to the letter to company employess, Dayton Hudson
management has moved in two directions to fend off a takeover.
According to the letter, chairman Kenneth Macke expressed to
the group buying its stock the company's desire to remain
independent.
    Dayton Hudson Thursday night met with Minnesota governor
Rudy Perpich, appealing for legislative help.
    A spokesman for Governor Perpich earlier said the governor
is expected later today to recommend stiffening the state's
anti-takeover law to help the Minneopolis retailer defend
itself.
    Minnesota House speaker designate said the legislators
would probably look at language similar to that contained in
Indiana and New York law. He said any amendment proposed would
probably be designed to thwart a company from dismantling a
company for its own profit.
   "Obviously Dayton-Hudson people feel whatever statutes we
have would not protect them enough," Vanasek said.
