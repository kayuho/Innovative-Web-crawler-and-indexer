<TITLE>BANGLADESH SHIPPING EMPLOYEES CALL OFF STRIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DHAKA, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nearly 1,000 employees of Bangladesh
Shipping Corp called off their two-week-old strike on Saturday
after the authorities agreed to consider their demands for
higher wages and benefits, corporation officials said.
    The employees walked out on June 11 over their demands,
forcing the government-run corporation to engage navy personnel
to unload grain at the country's biggest Chittagong port.
    Anwarul Haq, director of the corporation, said the strikers
joined their work this morning after the authorities assured
them they would review their demands soon.
