<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>A spokesman for Continental Illinois

    Rumors circulated on Wall Street today that Continental
would soon join the long list of banks adding to reserves. Some
analysts speculated that a decision would be announced after

month, but their agenda is confidential," the spokesman said.
He said "we will not comment on any rumors."
