<TITLE>EXXON &lt;XON&gt; EXTENDS MID-GRADE UNLEADED MARKETING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Exxon Co U.S.A. said it is extending
marketing of its mid-grade unleaded gasoline, Exxon Plus, into
the Houston and Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan areas beginning
early next month.
    Exxon Corp's domestic subsidiary is already marketing the
89-octane unleaded gasoline along much of the East Coast.
    As it introduces the third unleaded grade, Exxon noted, it
no longer offers a leaded gasoline in the market, except in
some rural areas where leaded gaosline will be made available
to distributors who have a substantial need for the product to
serve customers whose equipment was designed for leaded fuel.
