<TITLE>GANDHI PARTY BADLY DEFEATED IN INDIA STATE POLL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW DELHI, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress
(I) party was swept from power in the northern state of Haryana
by an opposition landslide.
    The loss was a major personal setback for Gandhi whose
vote-winning ability was on trial after political scandals in
Delhi and a string of electoral losses since he took command of
the party in 1984.
    With 53 results in for Haryana's 90-seat assembly, Congress
had won only two seats against 63 previously. Before the poll,
Congress politicians in Delhi said privately that a loss in
Haryana could open a party leadership debate.
