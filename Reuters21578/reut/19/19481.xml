<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Endotronics Inc said operations at
its joint venture with Summa Medical Corp &lt;SUMA.O&gt; has ended.
    The company said the venture provided production and
purification services to biotechnology companies on a contract
basis. Endotronics, which is reorganizing under Chapter 11, has
a 75 pct stake in the partnership.
    The company said it intends to sell the facility that
housed the operations.
    It said it is reviewing the adequacy of a two mln dlr
reserve set up in the second quarter ended March 31 for the
carrying value of the facility.
    The company said the cessation of the joint venture was the
second move taken to refocus its operations on the
instrumentation business. The company previously said it was no
longer performing research and development for its health care
technologies.
