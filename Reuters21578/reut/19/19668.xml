<TITLE>DANISH CROPS TWO WEEKS BEHIND, OFFICIAL REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    COPENHAGEN, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Danish crops are up to two weeks
behind normal growth levels due to the cold weather in May and
June, when mean temperatures were up to four centigrade below
average, the State Plant Cultivation Bureau said in a report.
    At the season's first crop test on June 26, the bureau
rated crops at an overall 94, the same as on June 20 last year.
The figure of 100 represents normal in a year of average growth
conditions with no crop damage.
    The test gave ratings expressed as a factor of 100, as
follows - winter wheat 96 (last year 91), winter rye 97 (98),
winter barley 92 (90), spring barley 94 (98), oats 96 (98),
fodder and sugar beets 87 (96), winter rapeseed 98 (94), spring
rapeseed 94 (98).
    Final harvest figures for 1986 were not yet available.
