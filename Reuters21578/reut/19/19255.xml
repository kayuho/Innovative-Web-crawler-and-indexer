<TITLE>MINNESOTA MAY CONSIDER ANTI-TAKEOVER AMENDMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Minnesota Governor Rudy Perpich is
considering calling a special legislative session to consider
amendments to the state's anti-takeover statute, according to
the governor's office.
    A spokesman for the governor said nothing will be decided
today, but said the governor will evaluate later whether to
call a special session in the next few days.
   The governor's office said the possible action was triggered
by a proposal by Dayton-Hudson Corp &lt;DH&gt;, which has been the
subject of takeover rumors. A spokesman for the governor said
the company proposed several amendments to Perpich designed to
make any takeover attempt in the state
more difficult.
       
    Dayton-Hudson suggested amendments be passed and instituted
by next Friday, the spokesperson said.
    Press reports in Minneapolis newspapers this morning quoted
several legislators as saying they were inclined to support
legislation that would help Dayton-Hudson, according to a
governor's spokesperson.
   Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe was quoted as saying he
would be inclined to support any action that would help the
company, the spokesperson said.
   Robert Vanasek, the House speaker designate, was quoted in
the Minneapolis Star and Tribune as saying, "We are taking
their (Dayton-Hudson) concerns very seriously and we are going
to do what we can to help."
