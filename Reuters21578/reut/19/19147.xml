<TITLE>BYRD URGES REAGAN TO GET INVOLVED IN BUDGET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senate majority leader Robert Byrd
urged President Reagan to negotiate with the Democratic-led
Congress over budget matters.
    He told reporters that Reagan and Republicans failed to
help write the budget expected to get final congressional
approval next week.
    He said it was time for Reagan to move from his "hobby horse"
and get into the negotiations over tax and defence matters, the
two issues dividing Reagan and Democrats.
    Reagan has said he would veto any bill implementing the
suggested 19 billion dlrs in 1988 taxes in the budget.
