<TITLE>A.H. ROBINS &lt;QRAH&gt; TO CONSIDER RORER OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RICHMOND, Va., June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>A.H. Robins Co said its board
has concluded that the merger proposal submitted by Rorer Group
Inc &lt;ROR&gt; merits further consideration.
    At the request of the board, Rorer has agreed to extend
until 1800 EDT July 2 its deadline for response from A.H.
Robins.
    After Rorer announced its second bid for the company last
Thursday, analysts forecast that the Robins family, which holds
control of the company, would vigourously oppose any merger.
    But, the analysts added, that Robins desire to emerge
independent from two years of bankruptcy proceedings may be
thwarted by some Robins' shareholders who perceive a merger as
a more expedient way of dealing with the company's Dalkon
Shield related liabilities.
    After a failed first attempt earlier this year, Rorer's
latest merger plan calls for a share swap worth about 720 mln
dlrs.
    Rorer would also set up two trusts to cover the estimated
1.75 billion dlrs in liabilities to deal with about 320,000
claims by women who suffered maladies from the use of the
Dalkon Shield interuterine device.
