<TITLE>CANON STOPS PRODUCTION OF LOW-END WORD PROCESSORS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canon Inc &lt;CANN.T&gt; said it will stop making
Japanese language word processors with retail prices below
50,000 yen and consign production instead to &lt;Kyushu Matsushita
Electronic Co Ltd&gt;, a 51.75-pct owned unit of Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T&gt;.
    A Canon spokesman said the move reflects intense price
competition as Canon, Casio Computer Co Ltd &lt;CACT.T&gt; and others
compete in the growing market for low-end processors.
    Canon will focus production on more expensive and
sophisticated models which have more generous profit margins,
he said.
