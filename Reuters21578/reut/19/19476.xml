<DATELINE>    Caracas, june 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>venezuela may turn to the international
monetary fund for credits as part of the country's overall
effort to reestablish financial flows from abroad, finance

    "this is no secret. It's just one of the steps the executive

azpurua told reporters at the finance ministry.
    He did not specify what types of loans venezuela would seek

billion dollars), according to the fund's 1986 report.
