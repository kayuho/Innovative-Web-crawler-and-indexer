<TITLE>BROWN BOVERI OMITS DIVIDEND, PLANS WARRANT BOND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BADEN, Switzerland, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>BBC AG Brown Boveri und Cie
&lt;BBCZ.Z&gt; said it will omit dividend in 1986 for the second
consecutive year.
    It said it planned to invite shareholders and non-voting
stockholders to subscribe to a warrant bond issue of around 150
mln Swiss francs to be made after the June 2 annual meeting.
    The value of the stock subscription rights should
correspond roughly to the dividend of 30 francs per share paid
in 1984. The company also plans to issue participation
certificates with a par value of 70 mln Swiss francs, from
which existing shareholders are excluded.
