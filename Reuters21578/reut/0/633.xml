<TITLE>S/P MAY DOWNGRADE MACK TRUCKS &lt;MACK&gt; DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it placed
on creditwatch with negative implications Mack Trucks Inc's 140
mln dlrs of BB-plus senior debt.
    S and P said Mack lost significant market share in heavy
duty trucks last year. Through the nine months ended September
30, 1986, the company's pretax loss before restructuring costs,
equity income and extraordinary items widened to 30 mln dlrs
from 23 mln dlrs in the year earlier period, it noted.
    S and P withdrew the BB-plus ratings on the unit Mack
Financial Corp's 9-5/8 pct debentures due 1990 and 9-3/4 pct
debentures of 1991 as they were called for redemption.
