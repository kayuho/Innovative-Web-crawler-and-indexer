<TITLE>SEARS &lt;S&gt; TO RESTRUCTURE DISTRIBUTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sears, Roebuck and Co said it will
restructure its distribution operations, resulting in a 20 mln
dlr after-tax charge against earnings in its first quarter.
    The retailer on April 30 will close its major Chicago
distribution center as the first part of the restructuring. A
spokesman said up to 1,800 workers will be affected, with many
of them laid off. Some of the workers may be transferred to
other Sears operations.
    Sears said the restructuring and consolidation will save
about 150 mln dlrs by 1991.
    Sears said it will set up a nationwide network of seven
regions to handle all aspects of distribution of its products.
    The closing of the Chicago plant will be followed by the
shutdown of four other distribution units over the next several
years. Distribution centers will be closed in Boston, Atlanta,
Memphis and Minneapolis, with the Boston shutdown coming early
next year. No other closings are planned before 1989.
    A spokesman said that, while there will be layoffs at those
facilities, the company does not yet know how many workers will
be let go.
    Sears' distribution will be consolidated under regional
management in Columbus, Ohio, Dallas, Greensboro, N.C.,
Jacksonville, Fla., Kansas City, Mo., Los Angeles and
Philadelphia. However, Sears said it will also evaluate the
productivity of the Los Angeles and Philadelphia facilities "to
determine whether they will be modernized or relocated."
    Responsibility for ordering distribution center inventory
will be centralized in Chicago.
