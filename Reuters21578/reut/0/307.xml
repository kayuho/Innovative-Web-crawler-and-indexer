<TITLE>U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 800 MLN STG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it forecast a
shortage of around 800 mln stg in the money market today.
    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
some 1.61 billion stg.
    Partly offsetting this outflow, exchequer transactions and
a fall in note circulation will add around 425 mln stg and 360
mln stg respectively. In addition, bankers' balances above
target will add some 20 mln stg to the system today.
