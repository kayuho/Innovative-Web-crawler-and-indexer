<TITLE>U.S. ASKS JAPAN TO END AGRICULTURE IMPORT CONTROLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Wants Japan to eliminate import
controls on agricultural products within three years, visiting
U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis
told Eishiro Saito, Chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organisations (Keidanren), a spokesman for Keidanren said.
    The spokesman quoted Wallis as saying drastic measures
would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by
Congress.
    Wallis, who is attending a sub-cabinet-level bilateral
trade meeting, made the remark yesterday in talks with Saito.
    Wallis was quoted as saying the Reagan Administration wants
Japanese cooperation so the White House can ensure any U.S.
Trade bill is a moderate one, rather than containing
retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country.
    He was also quoted as saying the U.S. Would be pleased were
Japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five
years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three,
the spokesman said.
    Japan currently restricts imports of 22 agricultural
products. A ban on rice imports triggered recent U.S.
Complaints about Japan's agricultural policy.
