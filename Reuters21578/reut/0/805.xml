<TITLE>TEXAS AIR &lt;TEX&gt; UNIT TO BEGIN NEW SERVICE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MIAMI, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Texas Air Corp's Eastern Airlines said it
will offer low fare, night-time service from Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport to 18 U.S. cities.
    It had previously offered similar service out of Houston.
    The company said one-way fares range from 39 dlrs to St.
Louis to 89 dlrs to Los Angeles, San Francisco and other
cities. They are available at all times with no restrictions.
    Flights depart between 0100 and 0415 CST and arrive around
0600 local time. Normal baggage checking services are not
available because the flights carry air freight cargo so
passengers are limited to two pieces of carry-on baggage.
