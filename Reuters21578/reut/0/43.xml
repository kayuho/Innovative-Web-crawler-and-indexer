<TITLE>SHULTZ SAYS NO RESIGNATION OVER IRAN REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ANCHORAGE, Alaska, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Secretary of State George
Shultz acknowledged failings in the Iran arms affair but
declared he would not resign.
    His role in the scandal that has scarred the Reagan
administration attracted harsh criticism from the Tower
commission in its report on the affair published today.
    Shultz, travelling to China for a week-long visit, refused
to comment directly on the report, published after he had left
Washington. But he repeated -- as he has done since the crisis
broke last November -- that he was not going to resign.
    "You can wipe that off your slate," he said.
