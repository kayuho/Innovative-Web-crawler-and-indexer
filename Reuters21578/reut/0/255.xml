<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz is
likely to visit Moscow soon for talks following new Soviet arms
control proposals, U.S. Officials said.
    The officials told Reuters no decision had been reached on
when the trip might take place, but it was likely to be within
a month.
    Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev proposed on Saturday that
talks on medium range missiles be separated from other arms
issues.
