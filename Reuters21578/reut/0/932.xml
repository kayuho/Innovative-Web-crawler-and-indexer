<TITLE>KLM TO TAKE 15 PCT STAKE IN AIR UK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>KLM Royal Dutch Airlines &lt;KLM.A&gt; said
it agreed to take a 15 pct stake in Air U.K. Ltd, a subsidiary
of British and Commonwealth Shipping Plc &lt;BCOM.L&gt;, in a
transaction worth around two mln stg.
   A KLM spokesman said KLM already cooperated closely with Air
UK, which runs 111 flights a week to Amsterdam's Schipol
airport from nine UK cities.
   British and Commonwealth Shipping said last week it held
preliminary talks about a KLM minority stake in Air U.K. But
gave no further details. KLM said it hoped the move would
attract more British feeder traffic to Amsterdam Airport.
