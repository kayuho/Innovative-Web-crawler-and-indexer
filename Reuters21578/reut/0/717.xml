<TITLE>U.S. ELECTRONIC SALES FLAT IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PALO ALTO, Calif, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. electronic companies'
sales last year totalled 226.5 billion dlrs, slightly below the
228.7 billion dlrs reported in 1985, the American Electronic
Association said.
    Despite the decline, the fourth-quarter total of 61.1
billion dlrs matched the industry record for the same period of
1984, the AEA said.
    AEA senior vice president Ralph Thomson said that, although
the 1986 sales trend was mostly positive with an upturn at the
end of the year, the industry is waiting early 1987 figures
before trying to forecast the future.
    "Many of our companies, including the semiconductor sector,
are still being impacted by the enormous and growing trade
deficit with Japan," he said.
    Fourth-quarter orders totalled 60 billion dlrs for a 3.1
pct increase over the same quarter of 1985. December sales were
22.2 billion dlrs, up 2.8 pct from the same month in 1985.
    The association represents more than 2,800 firms that
produce electronic goods and services.
