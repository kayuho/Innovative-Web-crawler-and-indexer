<TITLE>SAUDI ARABIA REITERATES COMMITMENT TO OPEC ACCORD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer
reiterated the kingdom's commitment to last December's OPEC
accord to boost world oil prices and stabilize the market, the
official Saudi Press Agency SPA said.
    Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market
oil prices, Nazer said Saudi Arabia "is fully adhering by the
... accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the
pronounced prices under any circumstance."
    Saudi Arabia was a main architect of December pact under
which OPEC agreed to cut its total oil output ceiling by 7.25
pct and return to fixed prices of around 18 dollars a barrel.
