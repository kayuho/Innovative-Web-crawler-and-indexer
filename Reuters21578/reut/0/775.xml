<TITLE>WARNER COMMUNICATIONS &lt;WCI&gt;IN CONTRACT WITH ROSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Warner Communications Inc said its
board has approved a 10-year employment contract with Chairman
Steven J. Ross.
    The company said the contract was opposed by the six board
members who are nominees of Chris-Craft Inc &lt;CCN&gt;.
    It said the new contract calls for "new bonus awards to be
paid out over the period of the contract," based on the price
of the company's stock. Its statement provided no details.
    Warner said the contract, which has been under discussion
for a lengthy period, assures the stability and creative future
of the company.
