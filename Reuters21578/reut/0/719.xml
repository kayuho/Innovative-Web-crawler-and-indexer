<TITLE>U.S. ACTS TO PROTECT KAISER STEEL RETIREES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, a
federal agency, said it took action to protect pensions of
employees and retirees of Kaiser Steel Corp, which filed for
bankruptcy reorganization last month.
    The agency said it entered into an agreement to terminate
the Kaiser plan, and was appointed its trustee.
    It said that Kaiser retirees will receive their March
pension checks without interruption and thereafter at levels
guaranteed by law.
