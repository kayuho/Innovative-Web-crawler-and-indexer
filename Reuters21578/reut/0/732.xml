<TITLE>ALBERTSON'S &lt;ABS&gt; ADOPTS STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOISE, Idaho, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Albertson's Inc said its board has
adopted a stockholder rights plan intended to protect them in
the event of any proposed takeover of the company.
    Under the plan, stockholders will receive a dividend
distribution of one right for each share of common stock held
on March 23.
    The rights are exercisable ten days after a person or group
acquires 20 pct or more of Alberston's common stock or
announces a tender offer for 30 pct or more of the stock.
    Each right will entitle the shareholder to buy one newly
issued share of Alberston's common stock for 150.00 dlrs.
