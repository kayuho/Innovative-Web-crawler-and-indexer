<TITLE>TEMPLE INLAND/INT'L PAPER UP ON RAISED OPINION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, MARCH 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Shares of Temple Inland Inc &lt;TIN&gt; and
International Paper Co &lt;IP&gt; rose sharply this morning following
a recommendation by Prudential Bache Securities, traders said.
    Temple Inland jumped 2-7/8 to 73 and International Paper 
1-1/4 to 91-1/4.
    Prudential Bache analyst Mark Rogers was not available for
comment. Traders said he raised his recommendation of Temple
Inland to a "buy" to support his earnings outlook of 5.85 dlrs
a share in 1987 and nine dlrs a share in 1988. The company
earned 3.30 dlrs a share in 1986.
    Traders also said that Rogers reiterated a recommendation
of International Paper, another forest products company that
scored large gains in January as the dollar floundered. Rogers
expects the company to earn 7.50 dlrs a share in 1987 and 10
dlrs a share in 1988. Last year the company earned 5.28 dlrs a
share.
