<TITLE>JAPAN BUYS SOME 95,000 TONNES SOYBEANS FROM CHINA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese importers bought some 95,000
tonnes of Chinese soybeans late last month for May to September
shipment, under the semi-annual trade accords, trade sources
said.
    The FOB premium rose to 13.50 dlrs per tonne, up 2.50 dlrs
from the premium for the November to April shipment, but down
from 13.80 for the last May to September shipment.
    Flat prices for Chinese beans are based on futures prices
in Chicago plus the FOB premium.
    Japanese purchases of Chinese soybeans, including spot
buying, may have totalled 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes of the 1986
crop for November to April 1987 shipment, down from some
300,000 tonnes the previous year, the sources said.
    Domestic demand for edible-use soybeans is expected to
remain stable at about 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes a year, the
sources said.
    In recent years Japanese importers have overbought Chinese
edible-use soybeans and sold the surplus to domestic crushers,
but low 1986 U.S. Crop prices have discouraged the purchase of
Chinese origin beans for crushing, they said.
