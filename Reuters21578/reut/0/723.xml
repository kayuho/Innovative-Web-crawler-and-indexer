<TITLE>CHEMICAL NEW YORK &lt;CHL&gt; TO CLOSE DUBAI OFFICE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chemical Bank, the main subsidiary of
Chemical New York Corp, is closing its representative office in
Dubai, United Arab Emirates, a spokeswoman said in response to
an enquiry.
    She said the decision to close the office was made as a
result of changes in Chemical's regional customer base and to
improve efficiency by centralizing the bank's Gulf activities
in Bahrain.
    The Bahrain office will assume the local contact role for
all of Chemical's corporate and institutional customers now
served by the Dubai office, the spokeswoman added.
