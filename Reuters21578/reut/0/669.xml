<TITLE>APPLE &lt;AAPL&gt;, AST &lt;ASTA&gt; OFFER MS-DOS PRODUCTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Apple Computer Inc and AST Research
Inc said they are offering two products that allow MS-DOS
software compatibility with Apple's new Macintosh SE and
Macintosh II.
    "Apple understands the importance of information sharing in
multiple vendor environments," said Apple Chairman John
Sculley, at a seminar where the new products were released.
    The products allow the new Macintosh computers to run
MS-DOS applications in a window at the speed of an IBM PC-XT
and IBM PC-AT.
    The products will require an external MS-DOS drive, which
Apple also announced today.
    Apple also introduced a host of other products, including
storage devices, memory upgrade kits, keyboards and two display
monitors.
    In addition, it announced jointly with Dow Jones and Co
&lt;DJ&gt; and MCI Communications Corp &lt;MCIC&gt; new electronic mail
software, called Desktop Express, that lets users send graphic
documents over telephone wires.
