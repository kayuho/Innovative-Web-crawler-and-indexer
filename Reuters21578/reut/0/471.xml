<TITLE>UNOCAL &lt;UCL&gt; PLANS LUBE CENTERS AT TRUCKSTOPS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Unocal Corp said it plans to introduce
truck lube centers at most of the 148 Unocal 76 Auto/TruckStops
along the nation's interstate highways.
    The company said the centers will be the first national
program to offer over-the-road trucks a convenient and complete
lube-and-oil-change service. The centers will offer a 20-point
lubrication and oil change at a suggested price of 99.95 dlrs
for most trucks.
    Unocal said the price will be the same or lower than
commercial grages and truckstops now charge in most areas.
