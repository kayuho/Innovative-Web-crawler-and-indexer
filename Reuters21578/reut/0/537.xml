<TITLE>NUEUTROGENA &lt;NGNA&gt; TO BUY BACK STOCK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Neutrogena Corp said it may purchase
up to 100,000 shares of its outstanding common stock from time
to time in the open market to reduce dilution from the future
issue of employee stock options.
    The company said it currently has 9.2 mln shares
outstanding.
    It said the shares that may be purchased and those
currently outstanding will be adjusted to reflect a
three-for-two stock split effective March two.
