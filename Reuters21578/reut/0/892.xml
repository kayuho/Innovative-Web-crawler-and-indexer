<TITLE>EGYPT ALLOWS FUGITIVE LIBYANS STAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CAIRO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Egypt allowed five fugitive Libyan
soldiers who landed in a military plane in the far south of the
country last night to stay and flew them to Cairo, official
sources said.
    It appeared the government had agreed to demands by the
five -- two officers and three privates -- for political asylum
but there was no immediate announcement.
    Official sources said Egyptian servicemen flew the Libyans
north from Abu Simbel in their C-130 transport plane. The
status of the sixth Libyan on board, the pilot, was not
immediately known.
