<TITLE>PANHANDLE'S &lt;PEL&gt; TRUNKLINE REDUCES GAS RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Panhandle Eastern Corp's Trunkline Gas
Co pipeline subsidiary said it is reducing the commodity
component of its wholesale natural gas rate four pct, effective
immediately.
    In a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
Trunkline said, it is reducing its commodity rate -- the
portion of the total rate based on the price of gas -- to 2.58
dlrs per mln Btu from 2.69 dlrs per mln Btu.
    The company said the lower rate results from a reduction in
the average price the pipeline is paying for gas, adding this
reflects contract reformation agreemats with producers.
