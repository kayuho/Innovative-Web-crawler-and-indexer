<TITLE>BANGLADESH MOVES AGAINST LOAN DEFAULTERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DHAKA, March 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bangladesh police mounted a cross-country
hunt for defaulters on bank loans, arresting four
industrialists and issuing arrest warrants against 50 others
for failure to repay overdue obligations. No names were given.
    Metropolitan police told reporters the four arrested, put
under six month pre-trial detention, owed nearly 50.7 mln taka
-- the equivalent of about 1.7 mln dlrs -- to Bangladesh Shilpa
(Industrial) Bank.
    President Hossain Mohammad Ershad has said non-payers are
crippling the industrial sector. But the Chamber of Commerce
and industry said the crackdown would scare away entrepreneurs.
