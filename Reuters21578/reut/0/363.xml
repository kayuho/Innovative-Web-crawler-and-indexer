<TITLE>SPANISH FARMERS PROTEST, THEN CALL TRUCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spanish farmers demanding a better deal
from the European Community blocked roads and staged protest
rallies this weekend before their leaders announced a truce to
negotiate with the government.
    Spain joined the community at the start of last year and
farmers say they have suffered competition from EC imports
without sufficient compensation.
    Leaders of three of the farmers' organisations announced at
a press conference in Madrid yesterday they were suspending
protests to allow time for negotiations with the government on
their grievances.
