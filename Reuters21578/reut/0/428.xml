<TITLE>TANZANIA SAYS NO NEED FOR NEW ECONOMIC MEASURES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DAR ES SALAAM, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Tanzania's ruling Chama cha
Mapinduzi (CCM) party has endorsed the government's economic
reform programme but said it did not think more changes, such
as a further devaluation of the shilling, would be needed.
    Tanzania has devalued the shilling more than 65 pct in less
than a year and has started to overhaul inefficient government
firms in line with a package agreed with the IMF.
    The CCM's national executive committee said it was
satisfied with government efforts to implement IMF conditions.
"Measures taken so far are satisfactory and there is no need to
take other ones -- the devaluation of the shilling included," it
said.
    The committee's statement was in response to a government
report on the IMF package submitted last Thursday.
