<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN POLICE ARREST FORMER WESTPAC CLERK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australian police said they charged a
former currency clerk of Westpac Banking Corp &lt;WSTP.S&gt; with
misappropriating 8,300 dlrs in July in an alleged
foreign-exchange fraud.
    A spokeswoman for the New South Wales Corporate Affairs
Commission (CAC) said the arrest was part of its investigation
stemming from complaints from Westpac and &lt;Kleinwort Benson
Australia Ltd&gt;.
    CAC and Westpac officials said they were working out how
much money was involved, but said press reports it was as much
as five mln dlrs were probably exaggerated.
