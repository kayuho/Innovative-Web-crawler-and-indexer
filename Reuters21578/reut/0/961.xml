<TITLE>OERLIKON UNIT REJECTS DUTCH PATENT CHARGES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Oerlikon-Buehrle Holding AG &lt;OEBZ.Z&gt; unit
&lt;Contraves AG&gt; unequivocally rejects charges by NV Philips
Gloeilampenfabrieken &lt;PGLO.AS&gt; subsidiary &lt;Hollandse
Signaalapparaten BV&gt; that it violated patent rights in a radar
system developed by the latter, a Contraves official said.
    Max Baumann, a member of the Contraves board, told Reuters
his company was awaiting judgement in the case before a Zurich
court "quite calmly," but he declined to discuss it in detail.
    Signaal claims Contraves included the Dutch firm's patented
X/KA double-frequency radar in an anti-aircraft system. Baumann
said he expected judgement to take several months at least.
