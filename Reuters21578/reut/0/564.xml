said it integrated the senior management of Pacific Western and
recently acquired Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd in preparation
for the companies' merger this summer.
    Pacific Western said it appointed president and chief
executive Rhys Eaton as chairman and chief executive in the new
management structure, and Murray Sigler as president. Sigler
was previously president of Pacific Western's airline unit,
Pacific Western Airlines Ltd.
    Pacific Western acquired Canadian Pacific Air Lines for 300
mln dlrs last December from Canadian Pacific Ltd &lt;CP&gt;.
    Canadian Pacific Air Lines said president and chief
executive Donald Carty and four senior vice-presidents resigned
last week. Carty said in a company memorandum that he accepted
another senior post in commercial aviation and that some of the
vice-presidents were taking early retirment and others were
resigning for personal reasons.
    Pacific Western said the new management structure "will
facilitate our objective of proceeding quickly to successfully
position ourselves in the marketplace as a single airline
network beginning this summer."
