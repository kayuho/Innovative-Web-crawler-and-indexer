<TITLE>SHULTZ VISIT TO MOSCOW POSSIBLE, SAY SOVIETS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>A senior Soviet official said a visit to
Moscow by U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz for arms
discussions was under consideration.
    Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Bessmertnykh told a news
conference such a visit would be part of continuing contacts
between the two powers "in the framework of security questions."
    Earlier, U.S. Officials with Shultz in Peking said he was
likely to go to Moscow soon following Kremlin leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's weekend proposal for a separate agreement on
withdrawing Soviet and American medium-range missiles from
Europe.
