ZIMBABWE MAIZE HARVEST LOWER AFTER BUMPER CROPS HARARE, March 3
- Zimbabwe's maize crop in 1986/87 (April/ March) is likely to
be slightly over 1.6 mln tonnes, against 1.83 mln in 1985/86,
Grain Marketing Board figures show.
    Maize exports for 1986/87 to January 31, 1987 totalled
315,000 tonnes, with about a further 40,000 tonnes expected to
be exported in February and March, against 285,000 tonnes in
1985/86. Domestic usage is estimated at 650,000-900,000 tonnes,
depending on how other crops are affected by current poor
rains. Last year's consumption was around 700,000 tonnes.
    Zimbabwe has around two mln stonnes of surplus maize in
storage, accumulated after two years of bumper harvests.
