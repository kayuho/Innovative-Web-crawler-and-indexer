<TITLE>EC MINISTERS POSTPONE TALKS ON SAVING DAIRY PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community (EC) farm ministers
early today abandoned talks aimed at saving an agreement on
cutting excessive milk production after making no progress in
over 12 hours of negotiations.
    The ministers will resume talks at 10.00 local time in a
bid to clear the way for a full-scale review of proposed
reforms for other surplus sectors.
    Diplomats said member states were unable to settle
differences over new rules limiting farmers' automatic right to
sell unwanted butter at high guaranteed prices into EC cold
stores. West Germany and Ireland are opposed to the steps.
