<TITLE>SONY TO EXPAND U.K. TELEVISION OUTPUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sony (U.K.) Ltd said it would be doubling
capacity at its Bridgend, Wales, television and components
factory over the next three years in a 30 mln stg expansion.
    The expansion, backed by Welsh office grants, would make
Bridgend Sony's biggest tv manufacturing plant in Europe with
output of about 500,000 tv sets per year, a spokesman said.
    The move will add 300 jobs at Bridgend, bringing the total
workforce to 1,500 at the end of the three-year period.

spokesman said.
