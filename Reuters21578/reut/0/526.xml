<TITLE>LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE TO CLOSE TRADING FLOOR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The London Stock Exchange said its ruling
council has decided to close the trading floor for government
bonds (gilts) and equities in due course because most of the
business is now done between brokers' offices.
    A trading floor for traded options will be retained.
    Dwindling activity on the exchange floor reflects the
introduction of the new dealing system, known as SEAQ, which
was part of the Big Bang restructuring of the market last
October. Since then, brokers and market-makers have been
dealing on the basis of competing share quotes displayed on
screens.
