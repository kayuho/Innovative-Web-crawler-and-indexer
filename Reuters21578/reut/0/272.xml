<TITLE>NIPPON LIGHT METAL CONTINUES ALUMINIUM OUTPUT CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nippon Light Metal Co Ltd &lt;NLGT.T&gt;, which
has annual capacity of 63,000 tonnes, will continue primary
aluminium production at a rate of 35,000 tonnes owing to low
domestic and world prices and low water supplies at its
hydroelectric power plant, a company official said.
    Nippon, which has no plans to restore output to the 48,000
tonnes a year at which it was working until late 1986, will
become Japan's only smelter.
    &lt;Ryoka Light Metal Industries Ltd&gt; will stop smelting in
April owing to high power costs and low prices, and &lt;Mitsui
Aluminium Co Ltd&gt; has said it stopped smelting in February.
