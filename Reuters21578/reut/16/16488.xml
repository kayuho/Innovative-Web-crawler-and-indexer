<TITLE>AB ASTRA SHARE SPLIT TO WIDEN FOREIGN OWNERSHIP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>AB Astra &lt;ASTS.ST&gt; said it was
proposing a two-for-one share split and the issue in June of a
new series of foreign-targeted shares with lower voting rights
as part of a strategy to internationalise the company.
    The deal, which requires Swedish government approval, will
raise the percentage of foreign voting rights allowed in the
medical group to 22.5 pct from 20 pct, Astra said.
    An extraordinary meeting of Astra's board proposed the
creation of B free shares open to foreign buyers with one tenth
of a voting right per share. At present, Astra stock consists
of one series of restricted shares and one of free shares.
