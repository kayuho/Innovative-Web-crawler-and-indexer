<TITLE>SOUTHERN UNIT &lt;SO&gt; RATINGS AFFIRMED BY MOODY'S</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Services Inc said it
affirmed the ratings on 5.3 billion dlrs of debt of Georgia
Power Co, a unit of The Southern Co.
    Affirmed were the Baa-1 first mortgage bonds, secured
pollution control revenue bonds and cumulative preferred stock,
and the Baa-2 unsecured pollution control revenue bonds.
    Moody's said, however, that it may review the company's
debt ratings pending a rate decision by the Georgia Public
Service Commission due by October. If the rate order is
unconstructive, Moody's review would have negative implications
at that time, the agency noted.
