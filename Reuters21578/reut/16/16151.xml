<TITLE>BOND SAYS HE IS AIMING FOR GLOBAL MEDIA GROUP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PERTH, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bond Corp Holdings Ltd &lt;BONA.S&gt; plans to
use its 1.05 billion dlr acquisition of Kerry Packer's
television and radio holdings as the springboard to a global
media group, chairman Alan Bond said.
    Bond Corp's broadcasting float, &lt;Bond Media Ltd&gt;, was
geared for international expansion as a company specialising in
the electronic media, he told a news conference here after a
presentation on the new company to shareholders and analysts.
    "It's intended that we will be a global media company in the
fullness of time," Bond said.
    Bond Media will bring together Bond's existing broadcasting
interests and those recently acquired from Packer's
&lt;Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd&gt;.
    Bond Corp shareholders are being offered 50 pct of the new
company at 1.55 dlrs a share on a three-for-four basis.
    A presentation by underwriters A C Goode and Co Ltd and
Rivkin James Capel Ltd forecast Bond Media's net profit at 41
mln dlrs in 1987/88 ending June 30, rising to 72 mln in
1989/90.
