<TITLE>SEC TO PROBE TWO CONVICTED OF SECURITIES FRAUD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Securities and Exchange Commission
said it began a disciplinary review of two men who were
previously convicted of fraud for violations of  U.S.
securities laws.
    The SEC said Robert and Albert D'Elia were convicted
following allegations that they traded upon information
misappropriated from a financial printer in 1980 and 1981. The
D'Elias were officers and shareholders of Rad Securities Inc, a
Philadelphia broker-dealer.
    A hearing will be scheduled at a later date, the SEC said.
