<TITLE>MCGRAW-HILL &lt;MHP&gt; DIVESTS SOUTH AFRICAN UNIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>McGraw-Hill Inc said it has sold its
McGraw-Hill Book Co South Africa Pty Ltd subsidiary to a local
management group for an undisclosed amount of cash and halted
the sale of all products and services to South Africa.
    The company said the divestiture follows a resolution of
its board in February that cited increased political and social
unrest within South Africa and the refusal of the South African
government to abolish the apartheid system.
