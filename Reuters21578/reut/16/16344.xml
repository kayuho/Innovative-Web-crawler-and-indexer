<DATELINE>    DALLAS, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>DSC Communications Corp said it amended
an existing long term supply contract with MCI Communications

    Deliveries of the switch, the DEX 600E, are scheduled to
begin in third quarter of 1988 and end by year-end 1989, the
telecommunications systems company said.
