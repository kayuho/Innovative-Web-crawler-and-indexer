<TITLE>INTEREST RATE DIFFERENTIALS TOO SMALL, BANKER SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Swiss National Bank President Pierre
Languetin said a wider interest rate differential between the
dollar and stronger currencies was needed to brake the dollar's
fall.
    At a news conference, he said Japan and West Germany could
try to stimulate their economies further by expanding money
supply, but he added "I'm not so sure it would be desirable if
monetary policy became more expansive.
    "But what would be useful is a greater differential in
interest rates," he said.
