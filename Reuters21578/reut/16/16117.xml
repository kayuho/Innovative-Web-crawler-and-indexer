<TITLE>WESTERN MINING SELLS ACM STAKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MELBOURNE, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Western Mining Corp Holdings Ltd
&lt;WMNG.S&gt; (WMC) said it sold its entire holding of 22.13 mln
shares in the gold mining company &lt;Australian Consolidated
Minerals Ltd&gt; (ACM).
    WMC gave no details, but stockbrokers said the sale was
made at eight dlrs a share on Friday to a number of U.S.,
European and Australian investors through WMC's usual brokers.
    The company purchased the 19.9 pct parcel in early March

one-for-three bonus issue when Amax sold its entire 47 pct
stake in ACM to a number of local companies.
