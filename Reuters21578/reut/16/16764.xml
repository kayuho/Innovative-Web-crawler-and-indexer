<DATELINE>    SEOUL, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea's Securities Supervisory
Board has ordered securities houses to report by tomorrow the
list of their clients holding shares worth 100 mln won or more,
Board officials said.
    They said the order was aimed at preventing large investors
from manipulating the Seoul exchange to make illegal margin
profits. "It was believed that such shareholders were
responsible for overheating the market earlier this year," one
official told Reuters. No further details were given.
