<TITLE>FED EXPECTED TO SET THREE-DAY REPURCHASE PACTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve is expected to
enter the U.S. Government securities market to add temporary
reserves directly by arranging three-day System repurchase
agreements, economists said.
    They said the Fed may add the reserves indirectly instead
via a large round, two billion dlrs or more, of customer
repurchase agreements.
    Federal funds, which averaged a high 6.35 pct on Friday,
