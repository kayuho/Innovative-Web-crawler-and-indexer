<TITLE>MOODY'S MAY DOWNGRADE IRVING &lt;V&gt; DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
may downgrade 950 mln dlrs of debt of Irving Bank Corp and lead
bank Irving Trust Co.
    The rating agency said it will assess Irving's ability to
substantially improve operating results in increasingly
competitive markets. The review will also focus on Irving's
shifting risk profile in light of its modest capital base.
    Moody's cited the bank's significant exposure to less
developed countries. Under review are the parent's Aa-3 senior
debt, A-1 subordinated debt and Aa-3 preferred stock and Irving
Trust's Aa-1 long-term desposits and letters of credit.
