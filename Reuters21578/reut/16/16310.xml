<TITLE>CANADA JANUARY LEADING INDICATOR UP 0.4 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada's leading composite indicator
rose 0.4 pct in January with eight of the 10 major components
posting gains, the most widespread monthly advance in the past
year, Statistics Canada said.
    The index also gained 0.4 pct in the preceeding month. The
unfiltered index, however, fell 0.1 pct in January after rising
1.0 pct in December.
    The gain was led by the residential construction index
while the manufacturing groups continued to improve and the
stock market index turned up, the federal agency reported.
