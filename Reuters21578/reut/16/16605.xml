<TITLE>BELL ATLANTIC &lt;BEL&gt; UNIT TO SELL SERVICES, GEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PHILADELPHIA, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bell Atlantic Corp's Bell of
Pennsylvania unit said federal regulators granted it interim
permission to sell regulated telecommunications network
services along with equipment provided by an unregulated Bell
Atlantic unit.
    In January, the Federal Communications Commission ruled
that Bell telephone companies could sell their telephone
services in tandem with equipment provided by their unregulated
equipment units.
    But the FCC stipulated that the Bell companies must comply
with new accounting rules that separate the costs of regulated
telephone service from those of unregulated businesses.
    Bell of Pennsylvnia said the FCC gave it interim relief to
jointly market services and equipment until its accounting plan
is approved by the commission.
