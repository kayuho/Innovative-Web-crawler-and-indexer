<TITLE>LATEST BRITISH POLL HAS THATCHER STILL WAY AHEAD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 14 - </DATELINE><BODY>The latest British opinion poll gave
Margaret Thatcher's Conservative party a huge 17 point lead
over the opposition -- the highest rating yet for the prime
minister who is seeking a record third consecutive term.
    The poll in today's Sun popular tabloid showed the
Conservatives could win a solid majority of 125 seats in
Parliament in the next general election.
    Thatcher must call an election by June 1988 but is widely
expected to call it this year.
    The survey gave the Conservatives 44 pct of the votes,
left-wing Labour and the centrist Liberal-Social Democratic
Alliance 27 pct each.
