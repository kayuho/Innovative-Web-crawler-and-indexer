<TITLE>ANDOVER WAGES HBO &lt;HBOC&gt; PROXY WAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATLANTA, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Andover Group, a Virginia general
partnership, said it mailed proxies soliciting votes for a
slate of nominees to HBO and Co's board of directors.
   Last week, HBO and Co sent a letter urging shareholders
against the proxies.
    Andover said HBO has consistently refused to provide it
with internal financial information it considers essential to
formulate an acquisition offer. If its nominees are elected,
Andover said it will make a proposal to buy HBO on terms and
conditions to be determined at that time.
    The annual meeting is scheduled for April 30.
