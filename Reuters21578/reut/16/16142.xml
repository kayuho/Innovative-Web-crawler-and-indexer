<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Swedish industrial production rose
2.6 pct in February, after a 1.8 pct fall in January, showing a
4.4 pct rise over February 1986 and reaching its highest level
ever, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.
    The rise reflected recovery in almost all sectors after an
exceptionally cold spell in January, the Bureau said, adding
that the highest rises were seen in the forest, chemical and
metal industries.
