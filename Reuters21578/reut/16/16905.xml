<TITLE>GULF AND WESTERN &lt;GW&gt; RESPONDS TO VALVE SUIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gulf and Western Inc &lt;GW&gt; said it
believes it has no liability under an earlier reported lawsuit
seeking 500 mln dlrs in damages against it and two other
companies.
    The suit, filed by Niagara Mohawk Power Corp and other
owners of the Nine Mile Point Two nuclear plant, concerns the
design and fabrication of the ball valve system for the
facility.
    "Niagara Mohawk appears to be trying to shift their
responsibilities in connection with the construction of the
Nine Mile Point Two plant to others," Gulf and Western said.
    Gulf and Western said it has not yet seen the lawsuit.
    The company said a subsidiary no longer owned by it sold
the valves in question in 1977. Since then, the valves have
been subject to substantial modifications by others, it said.
