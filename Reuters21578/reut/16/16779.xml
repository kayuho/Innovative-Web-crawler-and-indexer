<TITLE>JAPAN SEES HIGHER MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH THIS QUARTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan said it forecast
Japan's broadly-defined M-2 money supply average plus
certificates of deposit (CDs) will rise by about nine pct in
the current April-June quarter against 8.5 pct a year earlier.
    Unadjusted M-2 plus CDs rose a preliminary 8.8 pct in
January/March 1987 compared with a nine pct rise a year
earlier, it said.
    The bank said the forecast rise is due to an increase in
floating deposits due to recent low interest rates and a shift
to private banks from the Bank of Japan of 400-1,000 billion
yen by the recently privatised Japanese Railways.
