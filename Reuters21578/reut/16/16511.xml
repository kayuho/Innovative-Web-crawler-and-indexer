<TITLE>GATT STAFF STRIKE OVER PAY AND PENSION LOSSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Some 340 General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT) secretariat staff staged a half-day strike in
protest against what they said was a sharp decline in salaries
and pensions.
    The stoppage forced postponement until tomorrow of a
scheduled meeting to check progress in a global round of
negotiations to liberalise world commerce launched last
September.
    Pickets at the entrance to the GATT offices said all but
seven or eight staff members took part in the strike.
