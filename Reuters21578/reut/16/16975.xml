<TITLE>SUGAR PLANTING IN WESTERN EUROPE, DELAY IN USSR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STATE COLLEGE, PA., April 21 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dry, warm weather over
Western Europe sugar beet areas this week will allow planting
to progress rapidly, private forecaster Accu-Weather Inc said.
    Sugar beet areas in Britain will be dry and warm Thursday
and Friday while beet areas from France to West Germany will
have dry, seasonable weather, becoming warmer.
    But damp, chilly weather will delay planting in all Soviet
beet areas, it said. Eastern Soviet sugar beet areas were windy
yesterday with rain and snow showers. Water equivalent amounts
were 0.10 of an inch.
    Showers or snow flurries will linger today and up to 0.30
of an inch of rain is likely tomorrow.
