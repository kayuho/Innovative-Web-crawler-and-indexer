<TITLE>SWISS NATIONAL BANK SELLS YEN AGAINST DOLLAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, April 21 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Swiss National Bank sold yen against
dollars, joining in concerted intervention by central banks, a
spokesman for the National Bank said.
    He declined to say which central banks had been active in
the market, but earlier today Tokyo dealers said the Bank of
Japan had intervened at 142.10 yen to the dollar, and market
sources here said they believed the Bundesbank was in the
market as well.
    The National Bank spokesman declined to specify the volume
of its dollar purchases or the rate paid.
