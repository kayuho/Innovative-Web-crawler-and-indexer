<TITLE>BANK OF FRANCE SEES PICKUP IN INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of France said in its latest
monthly report on the French economy it expected a pickup in
industrial production registered in March to gather steam over
the next few months.
    Without giving figures, the report said last month's rise,
partly linked to efforts to catch up with production lost
earlier this year through industrial action, was due mainly to
a firming of domestic demand.
    "New progress is expected in all main sectors except capital
goods where production will remain at its present level," the
report added.
    The upbeat report comes in the wake of grim March trade
balance figures which showed a deficit in industrial trade for
the first time since June 1982.
    While the automobile industry remained unchanged from
previously boosted levels, consumer goods production grew and
was expected to accelerate except in the area of domestic
appliances. Semi-finished goods showed a clear increase in all
sectors. Construction and civil engineering, boosted by a rise
in public works, also improved, while retail trade sales in all
sectors continued to slow.
