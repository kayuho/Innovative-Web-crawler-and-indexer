<TITLE>TRADE ISSUES STRAINING EC'S PATIENCE WITH JAPAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Member states of the European
Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which
they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open
its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.
    Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC
countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the
willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese
government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.
    However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as
EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.
   Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to
an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could
raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.
Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.
    The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations
entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed
to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of
the U.S.
    The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's
trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in
March, up from 1.94 billion in February.
