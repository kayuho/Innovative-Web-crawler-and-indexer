<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 14 - </DATELINE><BODY>The latest British opinion poll, gave
Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives a 17-point lead over the

could win a majority of 125 seats in Parliament in the next
general elections. Thatcher must call the elections by June

gave the Conservatives 44 pct, and left-wing Labour and the
centrist Liberal-Social Democratic Alliance 27 pct each.
