<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Paperboard Industries Corp&gt; said it
planned to make an unconditional 21 dlr a share cash offer for
&lt;Belkin Inc&gt;'s 7.6 mln common and 2.3 mln non-voting shares.
    Paperboard said Balaclava Enterprises Ltd, owned by Morris
Belkin, agreed to tender 98.2 pct of Belkin's common shares.
