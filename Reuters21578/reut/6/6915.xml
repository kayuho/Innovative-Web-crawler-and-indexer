<TITLE>REAGAN URGES REVISION OF HIGH TECH EXPORT LIMITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan has sent Congress
proposals to streamline high-tech export control procedures,
the White House said.
    "These proposals are part of the president's energetic
program to enhance America's competitiveness in the world
economy," it said in a written statement.
    It said the proposals included exempting from license
requirements a number of low technology items and allowing
foreign manufacturers to re-export U.S. parts and components up
to a certain level without U.S. government re-export
authorization.
