<TITLE>REAGAN UPBEAT ABOUT LATEST GNP FIGURES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan said the 1.1 pct
U.S. economic growth rate during the final quarter of 1986
"wasn't all that bad."
    The Commerce Department said the rate of growth of the
Gross National Product in the October-December period was only
slightly less than a preliminary estimate of 1.3 pct made
earlier.
    At the same time, it said inflation, as measured by the GNP
price deflator, rose by 0.7 pct during the period.
    Asked his reaction to the GNP report during a White House
photo session, Reagan replied, "It wasn't all that bad."
