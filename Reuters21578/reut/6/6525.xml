<TITLE>DEUTSCHE BABCOCK TO INCREASE DIVIDEND IN 1986/87</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OBERHAUSEN, West Germany, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Deutsche Babcock AG
&lt;DBCG.F&gt; will increase its dividend on results in the year
ending September 30, 1987, chief executive Helmut Wiehn said.
    Wiehn told a news conference Deutsche Babcock would double
the absolute amount it distributes to shareholders. This
overall increase would also be due partly to an increase of
nominal share capital by 100 mln marks to 350 mln marks.
    A higher dividend had been anticipated because Deutsche
Babcock has said in the past that it will only raise capital
when it can make a lasting improvement in the dividend.
