<TITLE>SWISSAIR ORDERS SIX MCDONNELL DOUGLAS MD-11 JETS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Swissair &lt;SWSZ.Z&gt; said it was confirming
six orders for the new MD-11 long-haul jet of McDonnell Douglas
Corp &lt;MD&gt; and had taken options for a further 12 planes.
    The order, which involved rejecting the A-340 plane being
built by the European Airbus consortium, is to replace the
airline's fleet of DC-10 aircraft in the early 1990s.
    Swissair said in December it was giving the MD-11 "primary"
consideration, and had reserved six places for delivery,
pending a final order.
