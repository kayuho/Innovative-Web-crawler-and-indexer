<TITLE>NEW ITALIAN TREASURY OFFER UNDERSUBSCRIBED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Market operators subscribed to less than
half of the 3,000 billion lire offer of a new type of indexed
government paper, figures from the Bank of Italy show.
    Operators subscribed to 1,427 billion lire of the 3,000
billion lire issue of seven-year discount certificates (CTs).
    The CTs, of 100 lire nominal value each, were offered for
competitive tender at a price of 74 lire. Yields are adjustable
annually and linked to those on 12-month treasury bills.
Effective net yield on the first coupon will be 9.66 pct. The

1,073 billion lire unassigned.
