<TITLE>EC OILS TAX, CANADA CORN RULING OPPOSED BY PANEL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, MARCH 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Senate Finance Committee
approved nonbinding resolutions urging the Reagan
administration oppose Canada's ruling on U.S corn imports and a
proposed new European Community tax on vegetable oils.
    The resolutions, approved by voice vote, now will be sent
to the Senate floor were they are expected to be approved.
    The EC oils measure, offered by Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.,
urges the administration to take strong retaliatory measures if
the tax is approved by the EC Council of Ministers.
    Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., offered the corn amendment
which urges the administration to file a complaint with the
GATT if the U.S. believes the corn decision by Canada was
unjustified. Canada recently imposed a permanent duty of 85
cents per bushel on U.S. corn imports.
