<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Texas Air Corp's Continental Airlines
and Eastern Air Lines said they will combine their frequent
flyer programs in late April.
    Frequent flyer members will begin receiving one monthly
statement that reflects combined earnings from both Continental
and Eastern, the companies said.
    Continental said reciprocity between the two programs was
established in June 1986 and allowed members of either program
to earn miles and redeem points for rewards from the other
carrier.
