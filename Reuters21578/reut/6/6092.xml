<TITLE>TOUSSIE GROUP SELLS HECK'S &lt;HEX&gt; SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>A shareholder group led by New York
investor Robert Toussie told the Securities and Exchange
Commission it sold off most of its holdings in Heck's Inc
common stock but reserved the right to again seek control of
the company in the future.
    The group, which includes the Edward A. Viner and Co
brokerage, said it sold 579,600 shares since March 5, leaving
it with 157,000 shares or 1.8 pct of the total outstanding.
    The group had proposed a takeover of Heck's in September
but later withdrew the offer, and Heck's on March 5 filed for
protection from its creditors under federal bankruptcy law.
