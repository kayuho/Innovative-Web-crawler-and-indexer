<TITLE>EAST RAND MINES EXPECT HIGHER GOLD PRODUCTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>   JOHANNESBURG, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>East Rand Proprietary Mines Ltd
said that barring any major disruption in production, it
expects 1987 gold output to top 10 tonnes after dropping to
9.223 tonnes last year from 10.251 in 1985.
    Chairman Clive Knobbs said in the annual report the mine
was expected to mill a higher tonnage while capital expenditure
during 1987 will be around 118.5 mln rand.
   The decline in gold production last year was due to a four
pct drop in tonnage milled and a seven pct decline in grade.
