<TITLE>BRAZILIAN RED MEAT OUTPUT DOWN SHARPLY - USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian red meat production in
1986 fell more than 20 pct to 1.9 mln tonnes due to drought
which reduced slaughter weight and to herd rebuilding which
started because of high cattle prices, the U.S. Agriculture
Department said.
    In its report on World Production and Trade Developments,
USDA said that in 1987, beef production is expected to reach
2.3 mln tonnes.
    Pork production in 1986 rose 83 pct to 1.1 mln tonnes due
to the sharp rise in beef prices and is expected to remain at
that level this year, USDA said.
