<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Egypt rejected all offers at a vegetable
oil import tender yesterday for unspecified amounts of
sunflowerseed oil and/or cottonseed oil, traders said. It has
asked for a renewal of offers on March 24.

Egypt's new landed contract terms which include a clause, "free
from radioactive contamination." Offers submitted were on old
contract terms, all of which were rejected.
