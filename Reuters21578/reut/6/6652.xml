<TITLE>IRAQ SAYS IT HIT SHIP IN GULF OFF IRAN TODAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAGHDAD, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iraq said its warplanes had hit a
vessel in the Gulf off the Iranian coast today, the third in
the past 24 hours.
    A military spokesman told the Iraqi news agency INA the
latest attack was at 1250 GMT. It earlier reported strikes at
0650 GMT and at 1930 GMT last night. The planes "dealt accurate
and effective blows" to the targets and returned safely to base.
    There was no immediate confirmation of the attacks from
Gulf shipping sources. The last confirmed Iraqi attack was on
on March 8, when an Iranian tanker was hit by a missile south
of Iran's Kharg island oil export terminal.
