<TITLE>HILTON &lt;HLT&gt; SEES IMPROVED FIRST QUARTER PROFITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hilton Hotels Corp expects earnings
per share for first quarter fiscal 1987 to March 31 to be about
90 cts compared with 70 cts a year earlier, Hilton Hotels
division president Carl Mottek said.
    He told a news conference the company expected costs for
its first 10 all-suite hotels, announced today, to be about 150
mln dlrs. Initial financing would come from the company's cash
flow. Later, Hilton plans to use borrowings from traditional
sources, he added.
    Hilton, which hopes to build 50 all-suite hotels within
five years, may take in partners in the new venture, he added.
