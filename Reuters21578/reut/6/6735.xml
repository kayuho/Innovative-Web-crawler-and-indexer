<TITLE>USSR CORN BUYING MAY BE 3.5 MLN TONNES--AMSTUTZ</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ****WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviet Union's recent corn
purchases from the United States could total as much as 3.5 mln
tonnes, U.S. Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said.
    "We are not sure how much (Soviets have bought) but we think
it could be as high as 3.5 mln tonnes," Amstutz told a House
Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee.
    He added that China also will need to import more corn this
year than earlier anticipated, but he gave no figures.
