<TITLE>COCONUT OIL CONTRACT TO CHANGE - DUTCH TRADERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Contract terms for trade in coconut
oil are to be changed from long tons to tonnes with effect from
the Aug/Sep contract onwards, Dutch vegetable oil traders said.
    Operators have already started to take account of the
expected change and reported at least one trade in tonnes for
Aug/Sept shipment yesterday.
    The Federation of Oils Seeds and Fats Associations, FOSFA,
in London said it had previously advised traders to adopt the
metric system for coconut oil transactions to bring the
commodity into line with other vegetable oils.
