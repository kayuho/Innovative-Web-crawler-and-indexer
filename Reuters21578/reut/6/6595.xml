<TITLE>N.Y. TRADERS SAY LATIN COFFEE PRODUCERS TO MEET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Several traders and analysts here told
Reuters Latin American coffee producers will meet this weekend
in Managua, Nicaragua. The purpose, they said, is to review the
breakdown of International Coffee Organization quota talks last
month and try to formulate a unified position ahead of possible
future negotiations.
    Two traders, who asked not to be named, said separately
Brazil is expected to attend the meeting along with most or all
of the Central American producers. The Central American
attendees would include Costa Rica and Honduras, who were part
of a minority producer group at the February talks that opposed
Brazil's position, they said.
    Another source, also requesting anonymity, said Colombia
probably will not attend.
