<TITLE>MURRAY OHIO &lt;MYO&gt; SEES HIGHER 1ST QTR EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRENTWOOD, Tenn., March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Murray Ohio Manufacturing
Co said it expects first quarter earnings to be higher than the
4,800,840 dlrs, or 1.25 dlrs per share, it recorded for the
first quarter of last year.
    The company, which produces lawn mowers and bicycles, said
earnings are ahead of last year due to increased lawn and
garden shipments in January and February and a record-setting
pace in March.
