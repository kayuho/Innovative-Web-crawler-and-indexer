<TITLE>TEXACO &lt;TX&gt; TO CEASE POSTING TEXAS OIL PRICE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, MARCH 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Texaco Refining and Marketing, an
operating subsidiary of Texaco Inc, said it would cease to post
crude oil prices for West Texas crudes at the end of this month
following a decision to discontinue purchase of crude oil from
leases, a Texaco spokesman in Houston said.
    But it will continue to purchase quantities of U.S. and
foreign crude oil for use in its refinery system, he added.
     The spokesman also said Texaco Trading and Transport Inc
would continue to acquire and market Texaco lease production as
well as other lease production. The company will continue to
post a Louisiana price, it said.
