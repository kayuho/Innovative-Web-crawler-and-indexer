<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>W.R. Grace and Co said it completed
the sale of its Bermans The Leather Experts retail business to
a new company in a management led buyout.
    Grace received 99.3 mln dlrs cash and will record a pretax
gain of about 37 mln dlrs in the first quarter, the company
said. An additional pretax gain of 19 mln dlrs will be deferred
until realization is more fully assured, it said.

buy up to 47.5 pct of the new company and has reinvested about
19 pct of the proceeds in debt of the new firm.
    Financing was provided by Prudential Insurance Co of
