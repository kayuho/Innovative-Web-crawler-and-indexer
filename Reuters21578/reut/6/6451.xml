<TITLE>DAVY CORP UNIT WINS INDIA SMELTER CONTRACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Davy McKee Ltd, a subsidiary of U.K.
Engineering and contruction company Davy Corp Plc, has been
awarded a contract worth around 15 mln stg for the design of a
zinc and lead smelter in India, a spokesman for the company
said.
    The contract is being funded by Britain's Overseas
Development Administration as part of a total grant of 73.65
mln stg to India's state-owned Hindustan Zinc Ltd.
    The grant is for the development of a major zinc and lead
mine and associated smelting complex in Rajastan, North West
India, the agency said.
    The agency said the project was expected to account for 44
pct of India's total production of zinc.
    A total 55 mln stg of the grant is allocated for the supply
of goods and services from Britain. The grant comes as part of
package announced on March 13 for Indian mineral development.
    The agency is also paying a further 31 mln stg to India's
coal sector, for the expansion of its indigenous coal
development programme, using British-designed longwall
technology.
