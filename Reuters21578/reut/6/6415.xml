<TITLE>SPANISH UNION VOTES AGAINST APRIL GENERAL STRIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spain's second largest union, the
Workers Commissions, CC.OO, has voted against a general strike
next month to back wage demands and oppose the government's
economic policies, a CC.OO spokesman said.
    The proposal for a general strike was narrowly defeated at
a meeting yesterday but union leaders voted instead for a
national week of strike action beginning on April 3 and urged
their members to concentrate their protests on April 10.
    The Socialist General Workers' Union, UGT, the country's
biggest union, is against a general strike but has joined
forces with CC.OO. To demand real wage rises this year.
