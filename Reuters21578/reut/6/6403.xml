<TITLE>BOYCOTT FORCES NAKASONE TO ADOPT STOP-GAP BUDGET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>An on-off parliamentary boycott has
forced Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone to adopt a
provisional budget, government officials said.
    Economic analysts saw this as another setback in Nakasone's
plans to overhaul the Japanese tax system.
    The parliamentary boycott by opposition parties over
Nakasone's plans for a five per cent sales tax has made it
impossible for the full 1987-88 budget to be passed by the
start of the fiscal year on April 1, government officials said.
