<TITLE>U.S. WHEAT GROWERS SET STATE DEPT TRADE MEETING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The National Association of Wheat
Growers, NAWG, board of directors is scheduled to meet
Secretary of State George Schultz and Undersecretary of State
Allen Wallis to discuss the Department's current role in farm
trade policy, the association said.
    NAWG President Jim Miller said in a statement that the
organization wanted to convey to Secretary Schultz the
importance that exports hold for U.S. agriculture and the
degree to which farmers are dependent upon favorable State
Department trade policies to remain profitable.
    "Foreign policy decisions of the U.S. State Department have
in the past severely hampered our efforts to move our product
to overseas markets," he said.
    Miller noted Secretary Schultz is scheduled to meet next
month with representatives of the Soviet Union, and the NAWG
"wanted to be certain the secretary was aware of our concerns
regarding the reopening of wheat trade with the Soviet Union."
    The annual spring NAWG board of directors meeting is held
in Washington to allow grower-leaders from around the country
to meet with their state congressional delegations and members
of the executive branch.
    The purpose is to discuss the current situation for
producing and marketing wheat and help set the legislative and
regulatory agenda for the coming year, the NAWG statement said.
