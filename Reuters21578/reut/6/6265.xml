<TITLE>FARM PROGRAM CHANGES OUTLINED BY USDA OFFICIAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Upcoming changes being considered in
the U.S. Agriculture Department's transportation and loan
programs were outlined by a USDA official today.
    Addressing the annual meeting of the National Grain and
Feed Association, Tom VonGarlem, assistant deputy administrator
for USDA's state and county operations, said the following
changes are under consideration by USDA.
    Termination of USDA's Transportation Assistance Program for
wheat, barley and sorghum would be proposed this week.
    Changes in USDA's reserve rotation program are also under
consideration, VonGarlem said. While the department has not
made any final decision, banning the use of pik and roll grain
in reserve rotation is under heavy consideration, he said.
    Changes in loan rates will definitely be looked at for next
year's crop, he said, with the option of making soybean loans
partially in cash and in certificates under consideration.
    VanGarlem said he will definitely not extend the 1987 crop
program signup, saying he sees no reason to do so at this time.
    He also said wheat will not be considered for a cash bonus
under the Conservation Reserve Program.
