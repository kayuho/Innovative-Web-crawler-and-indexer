<TITLE>BRISTOL-MYERS &lt;BMY&gt; SEEKS AIDS VACCINE TESTING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bristol-Myers Co &lt;BMY&gt; said it would
seek Food and Drug Administration permission to test its AIDS
vaccine in humans by the end of March.
    A company spokesman said the company will file an
investigational new drug application by the end of the month,
requesting the FDA to allow testing of the vaccine in humans.
    Scientists at the company's Genetic Systems unit created an
AIDS vaccine, which Bristol-Myers said produced antibodies to
the AIDS virus in mice and monkeys. The vaccine consists of
smallpox virus remodeled to carry a key gene found on the AIDS
virus.
    Drug industry analysts said that that before the FDA would
allow the vaccine to be tested, a number of safety issues would
have to be resolved. Bristol-Myers said that by piggy-backing
two AIDS virus proteins with the small pox virus, a hybrid
virus is created that simulataneously immunizes against
smallpox and the AIDS virus proteins.
    The vaccine uses two proteins found on the surface of the
AIDS virus. The AIDS virus contains a number of such proteins
and it is not yet known which ones would provoke immunity
against AIDS.
