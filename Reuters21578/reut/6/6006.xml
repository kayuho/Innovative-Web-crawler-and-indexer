<TITLE>KANSAS LEGISLATOR TO OFFER U.S. 0/92 BILL TODAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan.,
chairman of the House Agriculture subcommittee on wheat,
soybeans and feedgrains, said he would today introduce a bill
to apply the so-called 0/92 concept to wheat and feedgrains
producers.
    Glickman told Reuters the measure would allow 1987 winter
wheat producers and 1988 feedgrains producers the possibility
of receiving no less than 92 pct of their income support
payments regardless of how much acreage they planted.
    He also said his bill would protect program participants
from reduced income payments in the event market prices rose
above the loan rate.
