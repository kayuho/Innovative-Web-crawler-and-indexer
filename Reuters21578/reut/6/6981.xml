<TITLE>U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 450 MLN STG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it forecast a
shortage of around 450 mln stg in the money market today.
    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
some 650 mln stg while a rise in note circulation will take out
around 30 mln stg.
    Partly offsetting these outflows, bankers' balances above
target and exchequer transactions will add some 200 mln stg and
35 mln stg to the system respectively.
