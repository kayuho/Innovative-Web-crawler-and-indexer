<TITLE>CHRYSLER &lt;C&gt; ACCELERATING STOCK BUYBACK PROGRAM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chrysler Corp said it is taking advantage
of current market conditions and accelerating a stock
repurchase program which began in 1984.

the second quarter of 1987 and is issuing about 15 mln

that goal, so far this year, Chrysler said it bought 750,000
shares a month.

speed that up considerably."
     Chrysler shares closed at 27 unchanged from yesterday when
