<DATELINE>    INDIANAPOLIS, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Circle Express Inc said negotiations
on its proposed acquisitions of Overland Express Inc and
privately-held Continental Training Services Inc have been
terminated by mutual agreement.
    The company said the recent declines in stock prices have
made it unlikely that the transactions could qualify as
tax-free reorganizations.
