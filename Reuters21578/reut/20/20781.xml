<TITLE>BAUSCH AND LOMB &lt;BOL&gt; TO REPURCHASE SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROCHESTER, N.Y., Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bausch and Lomb Inc said its
board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to three
mln of its 30.5 mln issued shares of common stock.
    The company said recent turmoil in the financial markets
has resulted in its stock being priced substantially below a
level which it believes to be an accurate reflection of the
company's present performance and future earnings potential.
    The shares will be repurchased at management's discretion,
either in the open market, or by private purchase, and will be
used in connection with acquisitions, stock options and
employee benefit plans.
