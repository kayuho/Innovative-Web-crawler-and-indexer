<TITLE>STOLTENBERG AGREES WITH POEHL ON INFLATION OUTLOOK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg said that there were absolutely no signs of current
dangers to price stability in West Germany.
    He was speaking at a news conference shortly after
Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl told a conference in
Frankfurt that inflationary fears, which have been responsible
for recent interest rate increases, were unjustified and
exaggerated.
