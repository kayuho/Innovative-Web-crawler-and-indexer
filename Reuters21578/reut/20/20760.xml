<TITLE>FLORIDA POWER &lt;FPL&gt; NUCLEAR FE PROPOSED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MIAMI, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>FPL Group Inc's Florida Power and Light Co
subsidiary said the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
has proposed a 225,000 dlr fine against the utility's Turkey
Point nuclear power plant based on three previously identified
incidents.
    At the same time, Florida Power said, the NRC issued an
order confirming the utility's commitment to implement a
package of programs designed to correct problems at the
facility.
   
    In a letter accompanying the order, the Florida Power said,
the NRC expressed concern about plant management controls, but
indicated support of the utility's initiatives and said these
efforts "should result in significant improvements in the
performance of site personnel."
    The three violations for which the fine was proposed
occurred between December 1986 and July 1987.
    Florida Power has 30 days to pay or appeal the proposed
fine, it said.
