<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Electrical engineering group AEG AG
&lt;AEGG.F&gt;, in which Daimler-Benz AG &lt;DAIG.F&gt; has a majority, is
reorganizing its energy business, AEG said in a statement.
    AEG will invest 250 mln marks over the next three years in
a new turbines, electrical machinery and power station plant
division, which will include its &lt;AEG Kanis GmbH&gt; subsidiary.
    The investment includes a new turbine factory for AEG Kanis
in Essen, and the restructuring of AEG's Nuremberg works into a
specialized components and rotor factory.
    The project is part of the Daimler group's energy
technology strategy, AEG said.
