<TITLE>KYOWA BANK SHORT-TERM RATES UPGRADED BY S/P</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it raised
short-term ratings to A-1-plus from A-1 of Kyowa Bank Ltd.
    S and P cited a steady progress in all major areas of
operation over the past few years. The upward trend in
profitability partly reflects decreased operating expenses as
interest margins have been historically strong, S and P added.
    It said Kyowa's capital ratios compare favorably with
domestic and international banking peers when some credit is
given for a substantial level of hidden reserves. Management
appears capable of taking necessary steps to cope with
financial deregulation of the domestic market, S and P added.
