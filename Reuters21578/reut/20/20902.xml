<TITLE>ITALY WORRIED AT RISING TENSION AFTER GULF ATTACK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Italian Prime Minister Giovanni Goria told
the cabinet on Monday he was worried about the increased
tension in the Gulf, but said America's retaliation against
Iran had been limited.
    A statement issued after a cabinet meeting said Goria had
been informed by the United States that it would take action
against an Iranian target in the Gulf, but had not known
beforehand that the action would involve an attack on an oil
platform.
    "The prime minister expressed his concern over the possible
consequences of increased tension in the Gulf, at the same time
recognizing the limited character of the American military
reaction to the attacks it has suffered in the past few days,"
the statement said.
    Goria said Italy's own ships were far from the platform at
the time of the attack and the fleet had been advised to follow
events with caution.
    Italy has sent eight ships, including three frigates and
three minesweepers, to the Gulf to protect Italian merchant
shipping there.
