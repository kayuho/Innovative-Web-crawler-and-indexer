<TITLE>LAWSON WELCOMES REAFFIRMATION OF LOUVRE ACCORD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, October 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson welcomed on Monday the reaffirmation by the U.S. And
West Germany of the Louvre accord aimed at stabilising
currencies.
    His office said Lawson had welcomed the outcome of a
meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, Bundesbank
President Karl Otto Poehl, and West German Finance Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg in Frankfurt.
    After the meeting, a Bonn finance ministry spokesman quoted
Stoltenberg as saying he was confident that foreign currencies
could be stabilised at around current levels.
    The meeting came after Baker criticised West Germany for
increasing key interest rates, saying they were not in line
with last February's Louvre accord.
