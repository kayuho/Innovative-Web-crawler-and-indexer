<TITLE>REAGAN SCRUBS RECEPTION TO KEEP EYE ON MARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20, Reuter - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan cancelled a
reception for Republican presidential candidates on Tuesday in
an apparent effort to make room in his schedule for a meeting
on stock market developments.
    "The postponement is being made to accomodate the
president's schedule today. The president continues to follow
developments in the stock market," the White House said.
    There was speculation that Reagan would meet with Treasury
Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan
Greenspan at 4 PM EDT, which was when the reception was to have
taken place.
