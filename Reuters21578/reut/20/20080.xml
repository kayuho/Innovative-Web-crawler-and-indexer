<TITLE>LOUVRE ACCORD VITAL TO W.GERMANY - STOLTENBERG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg said the Louvre accord was vital to West Germany.
    Stoltenberg told a news conference "Given West Germany's
unusually high dependence on world trade and exports, it is
vital for West Germany ... To continue its constructive
contribution to trusting (international) cooperation on the
basis of the Louvre accord."
    Some monetary analysts have speculated that
inflation-conscious Bundesbank vice president Helmut
Schlesinger may have been leading the central bank to a course
of tighter monetary policy.
    Stoltenberg is due to attend a routine Bundesbank meeting
on Thursday in West Berlin. He declined to forecast what, if
any, policy decisions the Bundesbank might take.
