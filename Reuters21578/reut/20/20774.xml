<TITLE>CONVOY RUNS GULF GAUNTLET, OTHER SHIPS STAY CLEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>A new convoy of tankers escorted by
American warships headed down the Gulf on Wednesday, towards
Iranian oil platforms still oozing smoke after having being
blasted by U.S. Navy raiders.
    Some Gulf sea captains were reported to be steering well
clear of Iran's Silkworm missiles, however, and frontline
emirate Kuwait redeployed air defences to counter the threat.
    "I think the predominant feeling ... Is of being scared this
conflict will escalate," a top West German Foreign Ministry
official, Helmut Schaefer, told reporters in Bahrain after a
tour of three Gulf states.

    Shipping sources said on Tuesday night at least six sea
captains had voiced fears that Iran would avenge Monday's U.S.
Raids by unleashing more Silkworm missiles at ships plying the
Gulf.
    Belgium decided two minesweepers en route for the Gulf
would stay out for the time being following Monday's U.S.
Action.
    But there was no sign that the prospect of more tit-for-tat
assaults had reduced the level of shipping activity in the
area.
    Iran, having vowed to react strongly after Monday's U.S.
Action, launched a barrage of threats and ridicule.
    For its part, Washington warned Iran again on Tuesday that
it was ready for any further hostile action.
    Pentagon officials then announced that a U.S. Guided
missile destroyer began escorting two Kuwaiti tankers flying
the U.S. flag southwards--the 80,000 tonne product carrier
Ocean City and 46,000 tonne petroleum tanker Gas King.
