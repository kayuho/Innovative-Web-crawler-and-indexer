<TITLE>NIKKO PULLS INTEC EQUITY WARRANT BOND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>A 100 mln dlr equity warrant bond for
Intec Inc &lt;INTT.T&gt; of Japan has been cancelled because of
turbulent market activity following today's 14.9 pct plunge in
Tokyo stock prices, Nikko Securities Co (Europe) Ltd said as
lead manager.
    The five year issue, on launched October 13, had terms
fixed yesterday, when it last traded at a bid only price of
less 2-1/4 pct, placing it on total fees, Nikko officials said.
    Indeed, dealers said stock price volatility shut down
trading altogether in Japanese equity related debt issues today
and cast doubt on the new issue calendar for the next few
weeks, during which as many as eight new deals were to be
launched.
