<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it
affirmed the debt of USX Corp and units.
    Total debt outstanding amounts to 2.8 billion dlrs.
    Affirmed were USX's BB-plus senior debt, BB-minus
subordinated debt and preferred stock, B-plus preference stock
and of the units, Marathon Oil Co and Texas Oil and Gas Corp's
BB-plus senior debt .
    S and P cited the firm's plan to repurchase up to 20 mln
common shares having a value of between 400 and 500 mln dlrs.
    The repurchase will increase the firm's high debt leverage,
but will not impair financial flexibility, S and P said.
