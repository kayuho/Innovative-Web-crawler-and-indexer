<TITLE>ARTILLERY SHELLS SAID TO FALL ON KUWAIT BORDER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUWAIT, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Artillery shells from an exchange of fire
between Iran and Iraq fell on Kuwait's northern border on
Tuesday but caused no casualties, the Kuwait News Agency KUNA
said, quoting a Defense Ministry official.
    There were rumors in world oil markets on Tuesday that Iran
had fired shells at an oil camp in northern Kuwait in
retaliation for U.S. Attacks on Iranian oil platforms in the
Gulf on Monday. "Several shells fell in a random manner on the
northern border of the country," the official told KUNA. "It
seems these shells arose from an exchange of fire between Iran
and Iraq... No one was wounded and there were no losses."
    Diplomats said shells from the nearby Iran-Iraq warfront
had in the past fallen in the northern Kuwaiti desert.
    A senior Kuwait Petroleum Corporation official had earlier
told Reuters he was unaware of any attack against Kuwaiti oil
installations.
