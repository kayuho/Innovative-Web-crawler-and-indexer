<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Salomon Inc said it offered to clear
transactions faster than normal for its mutual fund clients.

enable them to sell securities for cash if they need to do so.

clear transactions faster than normal settlement if that
accommodates their need," he said.
