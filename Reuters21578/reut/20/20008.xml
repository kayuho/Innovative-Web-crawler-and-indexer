<TITLE>MALAYSIA ADVISED TO RAISE CRUDE OIL OUTPUT IN 1988</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Malaysia's national oil company,
Petronas, has advised the government to raise crude oil output
to 540,000 barrels a day (bpd) in 1988 from a current 500,000
bpd, a senior company official said.
    "We have the capacity to produce the amount," Rastam Hadi,
Petronas's Vice-President for Upstream Sector said.
    The government will announce its decision on Friday when it
unveils the country's budget. Malaysia raised output this month
to current levels from 420,000 bpd after reviewing the world
oil market. In May, Malaysia cut output to 420,000 bpd from
459,000 in response to a call by OPEC to boost prices.
