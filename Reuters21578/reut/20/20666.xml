<TITLE>BROOKLYN UNION &lt;BU&gt; TO BUY GAS FROM SHELL OIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brooklyn Union Gas Co said it has
contracted to purchase up to 60 mln cubic feet of natural gas
per day from Shell Oil Co, a Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD&gt; &lt;SC&gt;
subsidiary.
    Brooklyn Union said the long-term contract will cover about
15 pct of its total supplies.
    A spokesman said Shell and the utility agreed to not
disclose the length of the contract or the price of the gas,
which he described as competitive with a market sensitive
escalation formula.
   
    Brooklyn Union said the gas from Shell Oil will replace
about 25 pct of the gas previously supplied by Transco Energy
Inc's &lt;E&gt; Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp subsidiary.
    The utility said Transcontinental will transport the gas
being purchased from Shell Oil, possibly beginning as soon as
November 1.
