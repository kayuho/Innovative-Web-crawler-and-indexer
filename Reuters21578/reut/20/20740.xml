<TITLE>HERCULES &lt;HPC&gt; SEES DOUBLING IN UNIT'S SALES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Cooney</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WILMINGTON, Del., Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hercules Inc said its contract
award from Martin Marietta Corp &lt;ML&gt; to make upgraded solid
rocket motors for the Titan Four launch vehicle will help
double revenues at its Hercules Aerospace Co unit to two
billion dlrs by 1992.
    "We expect and we are fully confident that by 1992 we will
be a two billion dlr a year sales company. The space booster
program is a substantial part of that," Hercules Aerospace head
E.J. Sheehy told Reuters.
    Hercules Inc, which also produces specialty chemicals and
engineered polymers, had sales of 2.62 billion dlrs in 1986.
    The company said the initial and still unnegotatiated
contract for development and production of 15 sets of solid
rocket boosters for the Titan space vehicles is expected to
exceed 500 mln dlrs.
    Sheehy also said, "It is obvious that if this program goes
as everyone anticipates, that there will be substantial
production follow-on."
    He declined to specify the possible value of future related
contracts.
    Hercules Aerospace will spend about 100 mln dlrs to reach
full production levels, Sheehy said.
    Hercules Inc said the money was available from Hercules'
recent 1.49 billion dlr sale of its 38.5 pct stake in Himont
Inc &lt;HMT&gt; to Montedison S.p.A. &lt;MONI.MI&gt;.
