<TITLE>HELLER SEES GLOBAL TREND FOR BANK RULES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board member Robert
Heller said the trend toward global financial markets required
that all participants be treated even-handedly on such matters
as bank capital requirements.
    The recent U.S.-U.K. agreement on capital adequacy provided
a model for others, including Japan, Heller told a Georgetown
University conference on financial markets.
    "If they (the Japanese bank) want to do more business in
Europe or the United States they have got to adhere to
international standards," he said.
    Heller said there were talks currently between the United
States and Japan on bank rules.
    He said the trend toward internationalization in financial
services would cause markets to move to centers with the least
regulation.
    "That is not desirable.  We want to have a sensible amount
of regulation," Heller said.
