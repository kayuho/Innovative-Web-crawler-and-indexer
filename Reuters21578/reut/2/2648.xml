<TITLE>BAKER SEES LOWER JAPANESE TRADE SURPLUS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
said the Japanese trade surplus would begin to decline this
year.
    He told the National Newspaper Association "You're going to
see a reduction in the Japanese trade surplus -- some of it
this year".
    But he said the reduction would be due principally to the
exchange rate shifts since the Plaza Agreement, and these
shifts would take a long time to work their way through the
system.
