<TITLE>WORLD BANK HEAD SAYS BRAZIL MORATORIUM TEMPORARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>World Bank president Barber Conable
said he believed that Brazil would come up with a medium term
economic plan and that the current debt moritorium would be
temporary.
    Speaking briefly to reporters following an address before
the Export-Import Bank, Conable said that the bank had been
urging the Brazilian government to come up with a specific plan
designed to work the country out of its present economic
difficulty.
    "Brazil would like to come up with such a plan," he said,
adding: "the moritorium is likely to be a temporary affair."
    During his formal remarks, Conable made it clear that he
believed Brazil must take some specific internal action.
    He said "they have everyone's attention but it must be
followed by a construtive plan."
    He said that he expected Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson
Funaro, who he met with last week to discuss the Brazilian debt
suspension action, to return for further discussion but did not
currently have a specific meeting arranged.
    Conable also told the gathering of mostly commericial
bankers that in order for the Baker debt initiative to work all
parties to the program must be on board.
