<TITLE>SOUTH AFRICAN FIRM TO CONTINUE TESTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Africa's state-owned energy
firm Soekor said it would continue tests after striking oil
some 120 kms (75 miles) south-southwest of Mossel Bay.
    During production tests, about 5,000 barrels of oil and
five mln cubic feet of gas per day were produced, it said.
    "This oil discovery will be followed-up as soon as possible
by further seismic surveys and drilling. Should further
drilling and tests in the area yield positive results oil
production from a floating platform could be considered."
    Director General of Mineral and Energy Affairs Louw Alberts
announced the strike earlier but said it was uneconomic.
