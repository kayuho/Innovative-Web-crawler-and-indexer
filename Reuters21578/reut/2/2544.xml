<TITLE>VINER &lt;EAVKF&gt; VIABLE AFTER HECK'S &lt;HEX&gt; MOVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>E.A. Viner Holdings Ltd said the earlier
reported Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of Heck's Inc &lt;HEX&gt;, in
which Viner holds 408,000 shares, would not materially affect
Viner's capital position or its ability to carry on its
profitable brokerage business.
    Viner said its brokerage subsidiary, Edward A. Viner and Co
had regulatory capital of 24.5 mln U.S. dlrs at year-end 1986.
    The company said Heck's Chapter 11 filing could, however,
affect Viner's previously reported legal action to recover
costs from an aborted merger agreement with Heck's.
     It said it and the Toussie-Viner group, with which it made
the merger offer, were assessing their options regarding the
Heck's investment.
    Viner earlier reported a fourth quarter loss of 918,000
U.S. dlrs after a 1.5 mln dlr writedown of its stake in Heck's.
It earned 585,000 dlrs in the previous fourth quarter.
    Full-year earnings totaled 2.9 mln dlrs against a
year-earlier loss of 1.5 mln dlrs. The full-year earnings
included a 900,000 dlr net writedown of the Heck's stake, it
said.
