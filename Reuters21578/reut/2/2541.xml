<TITLE>WORLD BANK PRESIDENT EXPECTS BRAZILIAN DEBT PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>World Bank President Barber Conable
said he was confident Brazil would come up with a debt plan and
that the current suspension on commercial bank debt payments
would be temporary.
    He said Brazil's decision to stop payments on its debt had
captured the attention of the international community but the
country should now produce a plan to reform its overheated
economy.
    "They have everyone's attention but it must be followed by a
constructive plan," he said.
    Conable made his remarks before a group of commercial
bankers at a meeting sponsored by the Export-Import Bank and
later informally to reporters.
