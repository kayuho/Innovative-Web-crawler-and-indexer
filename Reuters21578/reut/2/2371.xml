<TITLE>NOVA SUBSIDIARY RAISES U.S. POLYETHYLENE PRICES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CALGARY, Alberta, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Novacor Inc, a unit of &lt;Nova,
an Alberta Corp&gt;, said it would raise prices for U.S. customers
by five cts a pound on linear low-density and low-density
polyethylene, effective April 1.
    The company did not immediately disclose the actual new
prices.
    A Novacor official later said in reply to an inquiry that
the new prices, effective April 1, would range from 31 U.S. cts
a pound to about 38 cts.
    The official said the increase reflected improved market
conditions, although he noted the new prices would still be
lower than those of three years ago.
