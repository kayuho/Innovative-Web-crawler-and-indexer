<TITLE>EXIM BANK UNVEILS RISK RELATED FEES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Export Import Bank president John
Bohn said the agency was adopting a new policy of increased
risk coverage and as part of it will adopt a system of
risk-related fees.
    In an address before the Ex-Im's annual bankers conference
Bohn outlined a series of measures designed to bridge the gap
between reduced export lending by commercial banks and
activities by U.S. trading partners.
    Bohn said the bank will be more selective in requiring
soverign guarantees and will consider well-conceived projects
"even if they do not earn foreign exchange."
    He said the Exim will operate four broad programs after May
1. They are short-term insurance, a direct loan program that
will be available for both medium and long-term transactions, a
guarantee program and intermediary funding program.
    For medium-term guarantees, Bohn said Exim will increase
exporter coverage for commercial risks from the 85 pct
currently to 98 pct.
