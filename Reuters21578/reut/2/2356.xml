said the Canadian unit of American Home Products Corp's Ayerst
Labs subsidiary will probably receive marketing and
distribution rights to its cholesterol lowering drug Dexide,
now in clinical trials in Canada.
    George Usher, president of Dextran Products Limited, the
Canadian subsidiary of Polydex, said that the company will file
in August to both U.S. and Canadian regulatory authorities to
receive marketing approval for the drug. He also said that
American Home Products would quite possibly get distribution
