<TITLE>CANADIAN NATURAL RESOURCES TO SELL STAKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Calgary, Alberta, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Canadian Natural Resources
Ltd&gt; said it agreed in principle to sell 80 pct of its working
interest in certain producing and non-producing natural gas
properties located in southwestern Saskatchewan.
    The transaction is expected to close on April 1, 1987, the
company said. It did not identify the buyer nor give the
selling price.
    Proceeds will be used to satisfy a February 1987 repayment
demand by one of the company's lenders. Any excess proceeds
will be added to working capital, the company said.
