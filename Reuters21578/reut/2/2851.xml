<TITLE>USDA TO CONDUCT SURVEY FOR AVIAN INFLUENZA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Department animal
health officials are conducting a national survey of live-bird
markets and auctions to check for signs of avian influenza, an
infectious viral disease of poultry, the department said.
    The survey will locate poultry dealers and live-bird
markets that sell live birds directly to the consumer and once
the dealers and markets are identified, there will be tests to
determine any past or present exposure to avian influenza
viruses, it said.
    In 1983-84, an outbreak of avian influenza in Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Virginia and New Jersey cost taxpayers 65 mln dlrs to
control and required the destruction of more than 17 mln birds,
it said.
    The survey is expected to be completed by April 15.
