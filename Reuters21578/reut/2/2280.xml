<TITLE>SWISS GIVE ARGENTINA CREDIT FOR NUCLEAR PLANT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Switzerland's three major banks have
offered Argentina an extra 110.5 mln Swiss franc credit to help
finance the building of a heavy water plant there by Gebrueder
Sulzer AG &lt;SULZ.Z&gt;, Union Bank of Switzerland, UBS said.
    The three -- UBS, Credit Suisse and Swiss Bank Corp --
provided an initial 409 mln franc credit after Argentina signed
a contract with Sulzer in 1980. The plant will supply its
nuclear power industry.
    The extra credit, provided at market rates, covers extra
costs incurred due to building delays, a UBS spokesman said.
