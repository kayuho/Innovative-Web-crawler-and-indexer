<TITLE>SIX HURT IN SHOOTING AT SIKH TEMPLE IN AMRITSAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHANDIGARH, India, March 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Police and security forces
entered the Golden Temple in Amritsar after six people
including four policemen were wounded in a shooting incident in
the complex, police said.
    Police in Chandigarh, capital of Punjab state, said about
300 men entered the complex after a party of plainclothes
police were fired on, apparently by extremists campaigning for
a separate Sikh homeland.
    It was the first time uniformed police had entered
Sikhdom's holiest shrine since last June when extremists
stabbed a temple guard to death.
