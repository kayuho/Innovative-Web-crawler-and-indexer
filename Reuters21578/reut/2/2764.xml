<TITLE>COPPER MEETING AGREES GOALS OF STUDY GROUP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The world's major copper producing and
consuming countries have reached "a degree of consensus" on
objectives and functions of a future study group aimed at
reviewing the world copper market, officials said.
    Governments represented at a meeting to consider a proposed
forum for copper have recommended that another session be held
in September to consider further the nature of such a group, a
spokesman for the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) said.
    The one-week meeting, which ended today, was held to
examine a U.S. Initiative to set up a copper study group.
    The new body would not aim at negotiating measures to
stabilise depressed world prices.
    Its objectives would include increasing market
transparency, through improved statistics, and undertaking
activities aimed at developing the copper market and
contributing to improvement of demand.
    UNCTAD's spokesman said, "Once they have agreed on detailed
functions and objectives, then the way will be cleared to
setting up the body."
