<TITLE>SUN MICRO'S &lt;SUNW.O&gt; TOPS UPGRADES SOFTWARE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BERKELEY, Calif., Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sun Microsystems Co's TOPS
subsidiary said it will have upgraded versions of its NetPrint
and LAN -- local area network -- software packages available
early next month.
    The company said version 2.0 of its NetPrint will be
available November 10 at a suggested retail price of 189 dlrs.
NetPrint is software that enables International Business
Machines Corp &lt;IBM&gt; personal computers and compatibles print
directly to Apple Computer Inc &lt;AAPL.O&gt; LaserWriters or other
PostScript compatible printers on an AppleTalk network.
   
    TOPS said it will begin shipping version 2.0 of its LAN
software packages providing file sharing among Apple macintosh
computers, IBM PCs and compatibles, and UNIX-based systems to
retailers November six.
    It said the TOPS/DOS version 2.0, which will have a
suggested retail price of 189 dlrs, allows PCs on the network
to access dedicated printers fomerly availabe to only one user.
   
    The TOPS/Macintosh version 2.0, also listed at 189 dlrs,
introduces a "remember" function that allows users to make
files available to the network and access remote files
automatically. In addition, the software is now fully
compatible with all Apple File Protocol applications.
    Both LAN's include FlashTalk, a recently announced PC-to-PC
communications architecture that operates at three-times TOPS'
AppleTalk speed and is slated to sell for 239 dlrs.
