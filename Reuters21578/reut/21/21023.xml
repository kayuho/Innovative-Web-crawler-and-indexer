<TITLE>GERMAN BANKER CALLS FOR SPECIAL MONETARY MEETING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance ministers from major industrial
nations should hold a special meeting to deal with the U.S.
Dollar's sharp decline, Helmut Geiger, president of the West
German savings bank association, said.
    Geiger told Reuters: "Finance ministers should meet soon to
take confidence-building measures to limit the damage caused by
the dollar's fall."
    Separately, Geiger told Bild newspaper in an interview
released ahead of publication on Tuesday that the lower dollar,
which had been artificially talked down by U.S. officials,
would damage West German exports and cost jobs.
