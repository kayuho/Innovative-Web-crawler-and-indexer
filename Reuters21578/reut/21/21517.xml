<TITLE>IRAN WARNS U.S. AGAINST RAISING TENSION IN GULF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NICOSIA, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iran warned the United States on Monday
against exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying it would endanger
American interests.
    Tehran Radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting
Corporation, said a spokesman for Iran's War Information
Headquarters was responding "to U.S. Officials' remarks about
taking military action against Iran."
    The radio also quoted an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
as saying Iran would respond decisively to any aggressive
measure by the United States.
    The radio said the spokesman made the statement "following
the attack on a Kuwaiti ship under the U.S. Flag and comments
by American officials on carrying out retaliatory action
against Iran."
    The spokesman said, "Any U.S. Military aggression against
Iran will certainly be the beginning of an extensive clash in
the Persian Gulf, and amidst this our principled policy is to
confront any act which escalates tension."
