<TITLE>DEUTSCHE BANK CHIEF SAYS LOUVRE PACT STILL INTACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Deutsche Bank AG joint chief executive
Friedrich Wilhelm Christians said he believed the Louvre accord
on currency stability was still intact.
    Christians told a news conference he met U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker in the last two weeks, after short term
German interest rates had risen twice.
    "I am sure that with 1.7720 marks the dollar is still within
the Louvre agreement. I do not see that the accord has been
terminated," Christians said. He was responding to questions
about comments by Baker, who said the Louvre accord was still
operative but criticised rises in West German interest rates.
