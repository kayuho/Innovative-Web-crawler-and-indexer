<TITLE>FDIC'S SEIDMAN SAYS HIGHER RATES COULD HARM BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DALLAS, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chairman
William Seidman said he would be concerned about the impact on
banks of a further sharp rise in interest rates.
    However, Seidman, attending the American Bankers
Association convention, said he did not expect rates to rise
much higher and said the outlook for the U.S. economy and for
banking was sound.
    "The potential for greater interest rate rises gives us
concern. We see nothing right now in the outlook that causes us
to believe rates are going much higher or that the economy is
not sound," Seidman told a news conference.
