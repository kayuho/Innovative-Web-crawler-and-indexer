<TITLE>ASEA BROWN BOVERI SETS GROUP STRUCTURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Asea AB &lt;ASEA.ST&gt; said the group to be
formed by its merger with Switzerland's BBC AG Brown Boveri und
Cie &lt;BBCZ.Z&gt; would have four main business areas; power plants,
power transmission, power distribution and industrial
equipment.
    Asea Brown Boveri Ltd's international markets would
continue to be run by decentralised management, and the three
main home markets, Switzerland, West Germany and Sweden, would
continue to play an important role, Asea said in a statement.
    It said research and development were crucial to the
group's future and central reasearch resources and laboratories
in the three home markets would be strengthened.
