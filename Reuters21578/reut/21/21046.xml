<TITLE>HENLEY &lt;HENG.O&gt; ENDS TALKS WITH SANTE FE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LA JOLLA, Calif., Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Henley Group Inc said it ended
talks with Sante Fe Southern Pacific Corp concerning the
possible acquisition of Sante Fe's Southern Pacific
Transportation Co subsidiary.
    The company also said it is reviewing its investment in
Santa Fe Southern Pacific in light of Sante Fe's announcement
that it recieved several bids ranging from 750 mln dlrs to more
than one billion dlrs for its Southern Pafific Transportation
subsidiary.
   
    Henley said it held discussions with Sante Fe concerning
the acquisition by Henley of Bankers Leasing and Financial Corp
and certain Sante Fe transportation and real estate assets.
    Henley said it began talks with Sante Fe after it announced
its restructuring program in August 1987.
    As previously disclosed, Henley made necessary filings
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Acts to
permit Henley to increase its investment in Sante Fe to 24.9
pct of the outstanding common stock from 5.03 pct.
   
    Henley said that depending on prevailing conditions,
including price and availability of Sante Fe stock, substantial
developments affecting Sante Fe, other investment and business
opportunities available to Henley, Henley may additional Sante
Fe shares, or sell all or part of its investment in Sante Fe.
