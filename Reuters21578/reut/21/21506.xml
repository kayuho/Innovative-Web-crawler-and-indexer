<TITLE>KUWAITI OIL EXPORTS SAID NOT AFFECTED BY GULF WAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUWAIT, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kuwait's oil exports have not been
affected by the seven-year Iran-Iraq war, Kuwait Oil Tanker
Company (KOTC) Chairman and Managing Director Abdul Fattah
al-Bader told a Kuwaiti newspaper.
    "Kuwait has exploited all available opportunities to
continue exporting its oil without any reduction," the Al-Anbaa
newspaper quoted him as saying.
    He said KOTC made profits of more than two mln dinars
(seven mln dlrs) in the fiscal year ending last June, but
predicted lower profits this year due to higher costs for
chartering and operating vessels.
