<TITLE>ATLANTIS &lt;AGH&gt; MAY BID FOR CHARTER-CRELLIN&lt;CRTR.O&gt;</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Atlantis Group Inc said it bought
100,000 shares of Charter-Crellin Inc common stock, or 6.3 pct
of the total outstanding, and may seek control in a negotiated
transaction.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Atlantis said it has informally discussed a business
combination with Charter-Crellin management.
    But the company said it has not held negotiations with
Charter-Crellin and does not intend to initiate further
discussions.
    Pending development of specific proposals, Atlantis said it
will continue to purchase additional Charter-Crellin shares in
private or open market transactions depending on a range of
factors including the market price of the stock.
    Atlantis said it bought its Charter-Crellin common stock in
open market transactions between September 22 and October 7 at
14.91 dlrs to 15.62 dlrs a share, or for a total of about 1.51
mln dlrs.
