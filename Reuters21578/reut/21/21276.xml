<TITLE>TAKESHITA CHOSEN AS NEXT JAPAN PRIME MINISTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) on Tuesdayhose former Finance Minister Noboru Takeshita
to be the next prime minister, replacing Yasuhiro Nakasone
whose term ends on October 30.
    LDP officials told Reuters the choice was made by Nakasone
after Takeshita and two other contenders failed in marathon
closed-door meetings to agree who should be Japan's next
leader.
    They were vying for the presidency of the LDP, a post which
automatically carries with it the premiership by virtue of the
party's parliamentary majority.
