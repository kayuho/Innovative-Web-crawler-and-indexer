<TITLE>SENATE PANEL STUDIES LOAN RATE, SET ASIDE PLANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Senate Agriculture Committee was
expected to consider proposals that would limit adjustments in
county loan rate differentials which trigger larger corn and
wheat acreage reduction requirements, Senate staff said.
    A budget-saving proposal drafted by chairman Patrick Leahy
(D-Vt) would limit adjustments in county loan rate
differentials to no more than one pct per year from the
national average loan rate, starting with 1988 crops.
    The plan also would allow the Agriculture Secretary to
increase the unpaid acreage reduction requirement for corn by
"an appropriate amount to generate savings" if projected corn
stocks exceeded 6.0 billion bushels.
    Leahy's proposal would also allow a larger 1988 wheat set
aside if projected stocks surpassed 1.9 billion bushels.
