<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
raised to Baa-3 from Ba-1 about 86 mln dlrs of subordinated

    The rating agency cited Hechinger's consistently increasing
profitability and relatively stable financial structure.
Moody's pointed out that the company has minimal levels of
variable rate debt.

distribution outlet and 28 outlets planned in the next two
years. Moody's said the company's healthy cash flows, along
with outside financings, will be used to fund this growth.
