<TITLE>N.J. BUSINESS CONVERTS MAGAZINE TO MONTHLY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MORGANVILLE, N.J., March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Business Journal of New
Jersey said it will publish Garden State Home and Garden
monthly, beginning in September.
    The company said the publication was launched as a
bi-monthly in November 1986. The decision to covert to a
monthly was made as a result of increasing demand for
advertising space in the first four issues.
    The company also said it expects 1987 revenues of about
three mln dlrs, continuing average growth of over 50 pct for a
second year.
    A spokesman declined to release actual 1986, stating the
company had not completed its 10K report. For the first nine
months of 1986, it had sales of 1,070,000 dlrs while sales for
all of 1985 were a little less than one mln dlrs, he added.
