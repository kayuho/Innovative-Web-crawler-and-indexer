<TITLE>BRITAIN, JAPAN AGREE ON FLIGHTS OVER SIBERIA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 14 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain and Japan agreed to operate 12
flights a week over Siberia each other including eight non-stop
services from May 31, officials of the Transport Ministry said.
    The officials said both countries reached agreement at
their civil aviation talks here enabling British airline
companies to begin regular air service on the trans-Siberian
route between London and Tokyo. Japan Air Lines Co &lt;JAPN.T&gt;
(JAL) already operates one flight on that route.
    Ministry sources said &lt;British Airways&gt; and &lt;British
Caledonian Air Lines&gt; were expected to share the six British
flights each week over Siberia.
    They said Britain, currently operating seven weekly
Japan-Britain flights, all via Anchorage, Alaska, will be
allowed to operate a total of 10 flights a week from May 31.
    Under the agreement, the British side can also operate
flights from Tokyo to Seoul instead of Singapore.
    Japanese airway companies will be able to increase the
number of weekly flights to nine from May 31 from eight
currently, comprising six trans-Siberian flights, including
four non-stop flights, and three flights via Anchorage.
