<TITLE>LYNG SAYS TOO LATE FOR CROP DECOUPLING THIS YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said it is too late to implement a full 0/92 acreage
provision, or "decoupling," for 1987 grain crops.
    "I think there's a chance we'll see that legislation (0/92)
passed, (but) not for 1987 crops. It's too late," Lyng told the
National Grain and Feed Association convention here.
    Lyng added that there seems some support in Congress for
0/92 and there was a good chance a pilot 0/92 program will be
passed as part of a pending disaster bill.
    But he indicated that it is already too late in the year to
alter the 1987 crop program. Sign-up for spring crops closes
the end of this month.
    Overall, Lyng predicted very little change will be
legislated in the 1985 farm bill this year.
