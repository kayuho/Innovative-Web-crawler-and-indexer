<TITLE>JORDAN OBTAINS 98.8 MLN DLRS IN LOANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMMAN, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Jordan is to receive 98.8 mln dlrs in
loans to finance development projects, Planning Minister Taher
Kan'an said.
    Kan'an told reporters the loans, concluded during the past
six months, were made by the European Investment Bank, the
Islamic Development Bank and three Arab funds. He gave no other
details.
    Kan'an said the loans were for Jordan's own nine billion
dlr 1986-1990 development plan and not for the parallel,
controversial 1.3 billion dlr plan for the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and the Gaza strip.
    He said jordan would concentrate on obtaining concessionary
foreign loans and keep commercial borrowings to a minimum.
    Performance in the first year of the national plan was
close to target, the Minister said. The gross domestic product
at factor cost grew 2.4 per cent instead of the planned 2.9 per
cent, he added, but gave no figures.
    Kan'an said public investment was also near the planned
level, but investments by the private sector fell below
expectations. "The private sector still feels inhibited," he
said.
