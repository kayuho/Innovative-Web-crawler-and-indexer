<TITLE>BANK OF CHINA INCREASES CAPITAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 14 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of China, the state foreign
exchange and foreign trade bank, has increased its capital to
five billion yuan from three billion yuan, the New China News
Agency said.
    The bank's board of directors meeting here announced that
the increased funds had been allocated to the bank last
December.
    The meeting approved the bank's 1986 balance sheet, showing
total assets of 345 billion yuan by end-1986. No comparative
figure was given for 1985.
    A bank spokesman said the increased capital would enhance
its position at a time of rapidly expanding business.
    By end-1986, the bank had 369 domestic institutions and 347
elsewhere including Hong Kong and Macao.
