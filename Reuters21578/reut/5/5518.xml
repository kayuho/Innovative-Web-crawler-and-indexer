<TITLE>U.S. COULD COMPLAIN TO GATT ON CANADA CORN DUTY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter suggested the U.S. could file a formal complaint with
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) challenging
Canada's decision to impose duties on U.S. corn imports.
    Asked about the Canadian government decision to apply a
duty of 84.9 cents per bushel on U.S. corn shipments, Yeutter
said the U.S. could file a formal complaint with GATT under the
dispute settlement procedures of the subsidies code.
    Other U.S. options would be to appeal the decision in
Canadian courts, or to retaliate against Canadian goods, a
lower-level U.S. trade official said. However, retaliation is
an unlikely step, at least initially, that official said. No
decision on U.S. action is expected at least until after
documents on the ruling are received here later this week.
