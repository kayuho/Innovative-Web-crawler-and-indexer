<TITLE>BIFFEX MEMBERS TO BALLOT ON MERGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Members of the Baltic International
Freight Futures Exchange (BIFFEX) are to be balloted at the end
of this week on whether it will merge with the London Commodity
Exchange or come under a new umbrella of Baltic futures
exchanges, a BIFFEX official said.
    The final decision will be left with the BIFFEX board,
which will meet at the end of this month, he said.
    Last week three exchanges currently trading on the Baltic
Exchange, the London Potato Futures Association, the GAFTA Soya
Bean Meal Futures Association and the London Meat Futures
Exchange, instructed legal advisers to implement a merger.
