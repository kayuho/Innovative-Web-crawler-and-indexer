<TITLE>U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 450 MLN STG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it forecast a
shortage of around 450 mln stg in the money market today.
    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
some 650 mln stg while banker's balances below target will take
out around 50 mln stg.
    Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions
and a fall in note circulation will add some 200 mln stg and 50
mln stg to the system respectively.
