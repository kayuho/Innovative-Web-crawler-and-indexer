<TITLE>REAGAN TO HOLD NEWS CONFERENCE THURSDAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan, ending four months
of semi-isolation from the press, will hold a televised news
conference on Thursday, the White House said.
    Reagan is certain to be questioned extensively at the 2000
EST/0100 gmt session about the secret sale of arms to Iran and
skimming of profits to aid U.S.-backed "contra" rebels in
Nicaragua.
    During his last news conference on November 19, 1986 -- six
days before the fund diversion came to light -- Reagan strongly
defended the clandestine arms operation.
    During that session, the president also denied any third
country involvement in the Iran initiative even though it was
already known that Israel had played a key role in the arms
shipments. The White House was forced to issue a correction
following the news conference.
    Reagan's fumbling performance in that encounter with
reporters helped contribute to a sharp decline in his job
approval rating in various public opinion polls.
    Since the November 19 news conference, Reagan --who
maintains he knew nothing about the contra diversion -- has
revised his position on his covert Iran policy.
