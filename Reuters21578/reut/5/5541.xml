commercial gold production by mid-1988.
    The company said the mine would produce at an approximate
rate of 158,000 ounces of gold per year over the first four
full years of operation from 1989 through 1992 and at an
average of 133,000 ounces a year over the full projected
11-year life of the mine.
    BP's partner in the venture is Galactic Resources Ltd
