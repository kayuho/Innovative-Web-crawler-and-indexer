<TITLE>FORD &lt;F&gt; TO RECALL 33,600 FULL SIZE CARS</TITLE>

recalling about 33,600 of its 1987-model year Ford Crown

equipped with 5.0 -liter engines.

improperly manufactured sterring linkage components that could
fracture, causing reduced steering control.

caused by the conditions prompting the recall.

United States, 1,200 in Canada and 400 in export locations.
