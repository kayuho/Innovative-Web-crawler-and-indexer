<TITLE>THATCHER PARTY HAS NINE POINT POLL LEAD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain's ruling Conservatives have a
nine point lead over the main opposition Labour Party, their
biggest in two years, according to an opinion poll published
yesterday in the Sunday Times.
    The MORI poll's findings were the latest in a series of
setbacks for Labour and are bound to encourage talk that Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher may call a general election in June.
    The poll gives the Conservatives a rating of 41 pct against
32 pct for Labour and 25 pct for the centrist Liberal-Social
Democratic Alliance -- enough to give Thatcher an overall
majority of 46 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons. The poll
follows a survey by Marplan last week giving the Conservatives
a six-point lead over Labour.
