<TITLE>NO MAJOR FARM POLICY CHANGES THIS YEAR - DOLE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>There will be no significant changes
in U.S. agricultural policy this year, said Senate Minority
leader Robert Dole (R-Kan).
    Speaking at the annual convention of National Grain and
Feed Association, Dole said that while the current farm bill is
not perfect, "I still believe it is a step in the right
direction."
    Dole said he would like to reduce the costs of the program
but that expenditures will continue to be high until the U.S.
becomes more aggressive in its export policy through either the
broader use of the Export Enhancement Program or the
implementation of a market loan for wheat and feed grains.
    Commenting on whether the U.S. should offer the Soviet
Union subsidized grain, Dole said, "If your going to trade with
the Soviet Union you have to be competitive."
    He said one way to get around the problem of making direct
subsidies to the Soviets would be to implement a market loan,
which he said would make U.S. commodity prices competitive.
    Prospects for passage of mandatory production controls,
specifically the Harkin-Gephardt mandatory bill, are not good,
he said. "Mandatory has less support now than it did a year ago
and it will have even less support when people understand it,"
he said.
    If the House passes a pending 0/92 bill for 1987 winter
wheat, the Senate will try to address 0/92 for a one year
period, Dole added.
