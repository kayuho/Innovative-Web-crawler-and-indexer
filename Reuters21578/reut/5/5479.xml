<TITLE>U.K. AIRPORT AUTHORITY TO BE PRIVATISED IN SUMMER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 16 - State-owned &lt;BAA PLC&gt; - </DATELINE><BODY>formerly the
British Airports Authority - is to be privatised in June or
July of this year, Transport Secretary John Moore told
Parliament.
    He said BAA's 7,000 employees would each be given free
shares in BAA worth a nominal 100 stg. Employees would also
receive two free shares for each purchased, up to a maximum of
400 stg worth of free shares.
    BAA runs London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports, Stansted
and the Scottish airports. The flotation is to be managed by
&lt;Country Bank Ltd&gt;. Private studies have put total proceeds of
the BAA sell-off at just over one billion stg, analysts said.
