<TITLE>SENS. DANFORTH, BOND ASK TARGETED 0/92 MEASURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Missouri Republican Senators John
Danforth and Christopher Bond have introduced a bill that would
allow wheat and feedgrain producers along the Mississippi and
Missouri Rivers hurt by flooding last year to collect at least
92 pct of their deficiency payments this year without planting.
    Danforth aide Austin Schlick said the bill was similar to a
provision included in a House Agriculture Committee-passed
emergency disaster assistance bill scheduled to be taken up by
the House tomorrow.
    Schlick said flooding destroyed a number of levees along
the two rivers last October, leaving farmland there vulnerable
to further damage this year.
