<TITLE>COMBINED INT'L &lt;PMA&gt; HOLDERS TO VOTE ON SPLIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Combined International Corp said it
will ask shareholders at the April 23 annual meeting to approve
the doubling of authorized common shares to 120 mln.
    Holders will also vote on a proposal to create a new class
of 25 mln shares of serial preferred stock one dlr par value in
place of its existing classes of authorized and unissued
preferred stock.
    It said at its regular March board meeting members will
consider a stock split or stock dividend, which would be
contingent upon stockholder approval of the changes in the
capital structure at the April annual meeting.
    Holders will also be asked to approve a new corporate name,
Aon Corp. It said aon is a Gaelic word meaning unit. The name
is intended to eliminate confusion between the parent company
and its principal subsidiary, Combined Insurance Co of America.
    Holders will also vote on a proposal to limit the liability
of directors and amend the provision for indemnifying
directors, officers employees an agents. This is being done to
reduce the costs of liability insurance.
