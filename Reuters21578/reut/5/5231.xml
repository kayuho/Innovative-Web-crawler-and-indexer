<TITLE>ISRAELI INFLATION RATE IS 1.0 PCT IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JERUSALEM, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Israel's inflation rate for February
was one pct, compared to 2.1 pct in January and 1.6 pct in
February 1986, a spokesman for the Central Bureau of Statistics
said.
    Inflation for the 12 months ending in February was 23 pct,
the spokesman said.
    February price rises were mostly in housing, health,
education, entertainment and transport.
    Wage and price controls have been in force since August
1985. Officials said the controls have helped soften the effect
of a recent 10 pct devaluation of the shekel.
