<DATELINE>    PITTSBURGH, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rockwell International Corp said its
board has authorized extension of the company's 500 mln dlr

    Since the beginning of the present repurchase program in

potential acquisitions, stock options, employee benefit
programs, conversion of convertible securities and other
purposes.
    The company said, "We continue to view our repurchase
program as an integral part of our long term goal of improving
shareholder values."
    Rockwell said the program "complements our aggressive
program of support for the growth plans of our businesses with
capital investments, product and research development
resources, and acquisitions in support of our core businesses."
