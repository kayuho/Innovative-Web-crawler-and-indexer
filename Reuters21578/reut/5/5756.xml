<TITLE>CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW&gt; FILES SUIT AGAINST SOSNOFF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Caesars World Inc said it filed a
lawsuit against Martin T. Sosnoff and MTS Acquisition Corp
regarding its March 9 unsolicited tender offer for Caesars
World stock.
    The company said it filed in the Federal Court in the
Central District of California, charging the tender offer,
which its board rejected, violated federal securities laws and
federal margin regulations.
    The suit charges the offering materials are materially
false and misleading and misstate and conceal material
information required to be disclosed to shareholders.
    The suit also charges the offer is illusory and designed to
manipulate the market in Caesars World stock to enable Sosnoff
to sell the Caesars World stock he already owns for a
substantial profit.
    The complaint seeks, among other things, to enjoin the
tender offer and to require MTS and Sosnoff to correct false
and misleading statements in the offer.
    Caesars World is expected to seek a friendly suitor,
restructure operations, or buy back Sosnoff's holdings in an
attempt to fight off the bid.
    Sosnoff holds about 13.6 pct of the company's stock.
