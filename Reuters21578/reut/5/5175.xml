<TITLE>NO TAIWAN SUGAR EXPORTS EXPECTED THIS YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan is not expected to export sugar
this year because of falling production and growing domestic
consumption, state-owned Taiwan Sugar Corp said.
    A company spokesman told Reuters this will be the first
time in more than 40 years Taiwan has not exported sugar. Last
year, sugar exports totalled 149,755 tonnes.
    He said the actual production during the 1986/87 season
(November/May) is about 480,000 tonnes, barely enough to meet
local consumption. This compares with actual 1985/86 output of
570,000. He said the production fall was due to typhoon damage
to more than 6,000 hectares of canefields last year.
