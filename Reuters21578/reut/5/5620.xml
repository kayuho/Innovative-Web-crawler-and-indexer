<TITLE>SEVEN OAKS &lt;QPON&gt; IN TELEMARKETING VENTURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MEMPHIS, Tenn., March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Seven Oaks International Inc
said it has formed a new 80 pct owned subsidiary called Seven
Oaks Direct Inc to offer a full line of telemarketing services.
    It said Seven Oaks direct management will own the remaining
20 pct.
    The company said initial costs connected with the startupo
of a new Memphis, Tenn., marketing center for Seven Oaks direct
may hurt earnings slightly in the first half of the year ending
in April 1988, but Seven Oaks Direct should operate at no worse
than breakeven for fiscal 1988 as a whole.
