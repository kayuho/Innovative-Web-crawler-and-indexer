<TITLE>U.K. RETAIL SALES RISE 2.2 PCT IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The volume of U.K. Retail sales rose a
provisional, seasonally adjusted 2.2 pct in February after
falling a final 2.2 pct in January, figures released by the
Department of Trade and Industry show.
    The February sales index, base 1980, was put at a
preliminary 125.0 after a final 122.3 in January.
    In the three months from December to February, the level of
sales was little changed over the previous three months but was
nearly six pct higher than the same year ago period.
    On a non-seasonally adjusted value basis, retail sales in
February were a provisional 9.0 pct higher than a year earlier.
    The Department noted the latest figures were similar to the
average in the fourth quarter last year but well above the
January index, which was depressed by the effects of severe
weather.
    The February trading period comprised the four weeks
February 1 to 28. Final February retail sales figures will be
published on April 6.
