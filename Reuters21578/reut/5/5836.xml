<TITLE>TAIWAN ISSUES MORE CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan's central bank issued 12 billion
Taiwan dlrs worth of certificates of deposit after issuing six
billion yesterday, bringing CD issues so far this year to
115.47 billion dlrs, a bank official told Reuters.
    The new CDs have maturities of six months, one year and two
years and bear interest rates ranging from 4.07 pct to 5.12
pct, he said.
    The issues are aimed at helping curb the growth of M-1b
money supply, which is the result of large foreign exchange
reserves. The reserves now total more than 51 billion U.S.
Dlrs.
