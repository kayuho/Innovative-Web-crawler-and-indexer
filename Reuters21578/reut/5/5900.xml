<TITLE>CREDIT AGRICOLE REPLACES BNP IN HACHETTE TV BID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>French state agricultural bank &lt;Caisse
Nationale du Credit Agricole&gt; has joined the group led by
publishing house &lt;Hachette&gt; which is bidding for control of the
state television station TF1, replacing &lt;Banque Nationale de
Paris&gt; which has withdrawn, Hachette said in a statement.
    Credit Agricole's stake in the consortium will be 3.5 pct.
    Last week the broadcasting supervisory board asked Hachette
to remove BNP from the consortium because the bank had acted as
adviser to the government for the imminent privatisation of
TF1.
