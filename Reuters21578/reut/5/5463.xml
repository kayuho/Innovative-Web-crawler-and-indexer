<TITLE>PENN CENTRAL &lt;PC&gt; CAN'T EXPLAIN STOCK ACTIVITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>A spokesman for Penn Central Corp said
he was unable to explain a rise in the company's shares.
    Penn Central rose 2-1/4 to 55-7/8 on 538,000 shares by
midmorning.
    The spokesman noted the stock had dipped to 52-3/4 in
intrasession dealings Friday but closed at 53-5/8. The stock
had traded over 54 dlrs in the preceding week but was pressured
last week on a large block sale. The spokesman said he did not
know who the seller was. He said he did not believe it was Carl
Lindner, a Cincinnati investor who owns about 28 pct of Penn
Central's stock.
