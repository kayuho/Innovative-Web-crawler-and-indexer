<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>France's current account payments surplus
slipped to a provisional 300 mln francs, seasonally adjusted,

    The December figure was revised from a provisional 4.8

deficit while services showed a 3.7 billion surplus.
    Other items, mainly including unilateral transfers, showed
a 1.8 billion deficit.
    The current account showed an adjusted surplus of 6.1
billion francs in January last year, and an unadjusted deficit
of one billion.
    The full year 1986 current account surplus was reported
last month at 25.8 billion francs.
