<TITLE>WELLINGTON, AUCKLAND BANK STAFF ACCEPT PAY DEAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trading bank staff in Wellington and
Auckland voted to accept a 7.9 pct pay rise, ending any threat
of strike action, the Bank Officers Union said.
    Union president Angela Foulkes told Reuters that Wellington
and Auckland staff are still unhappy with the offer but
accepted it because they could not have forced a higher offer
when provincial union members had already accepted the 7.9 pct.
    Provincial bank staff approved the offer at meetings last
week but Wellington and Auckland workers had initially
threatened to strike in support of a higher claim.
