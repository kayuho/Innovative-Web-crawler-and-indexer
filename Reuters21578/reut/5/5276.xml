<TITLE>ALUSUISSE SHARES FALL AFTER CAPITAL CUT NEWS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bearer shares of Schweizerische
Aluminium AG &lt;ALUZ.Z&gt; (Alusuisse) fell sharply as trading
resumed after a one-day suspension on Friday, when the firm
disclosed plans for a capital cut.
    The bearers, held mainly by foreign investors, dropped 30
Swiss francs to 460. But volume was not particularly heavy.
Registered shares were less affected, slipping five to 165. The
participation certificates fell to 43 francs from 45.50.
    Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln francs, after a
restated 756 mln loss in 1985, and set a 50 pct capital cut.
The company said it could break even this year.
