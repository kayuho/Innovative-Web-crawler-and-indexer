<TITLE>LABATT CLAIMS 41 PCT SHARE OF CANADIAN MARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>John Labatt Ltd said its share of the
Canadian beer market is holding at more than 41 pct but the
total market has grown only three pct since last year when
volumes were depressed by labor disruptions in the industry.
    Labatt earlier reported profits in the third quarter ended
January 31 rose 20 pct to 26.2 mln dlrs from 21.8 mln a year
earlier, while nine month earnings were up almost as much to
92.8 mln dlrs from 78 mln dlrs.
    "Through acquisitions as well as growth in the core
businesses, all segments achieved both sales and earnings
improvement over a year ago," it said.
    Labatt purchased Tuscan Dairies, Green Spring Dairy,
EverFresh Juice Co and Pasquale Food Co in the third quarter.
    The company said cool wet weather last summer slowed total
market demand in the past nine months. "Lack of significant
market growth emphasizes the importance of customer service and
new product development," it added.
