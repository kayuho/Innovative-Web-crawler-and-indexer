<TITLE>DNA MEDICAL &lt;DNAM&gt; SIGNS PACT FOR STOCK SALE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SALT LAKE CITY, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>DNA Medical Inc said Walter G.
Mize had bought about 9,400,000 shares, or about 33 pct of
DNA's outstanding stock, for 100,000 dlrs cash.
    Under an agreement with Mize, DNA said he will also become
chairman, and may, at his option, expand the board to provide
him equal representation with the current board.
    DNA also said it will submit a proposal at its annual
meeting for it to acquire three companies owned by Mize,
&lt;Heritage Lite Meat Corp&gt;, &lt;National Lean Beef Corp&gt; and
&lt;Heritage Cattle &lt;Corp&gt;. DNA said the total value of the
transactions is 700,000 dlrs.
    DNA said that when the transactions are approved by its
shareholders, it will issue additional shares of its common so
that Mize will own 80 pct of its issued and outstanding stock.
    DNA said Mize will replace its current chairman, Donald
Holbrook, who will remain on the board.
    The company also said it will continue in the medical
development business as "long as it is deemed to be
advantageous."
