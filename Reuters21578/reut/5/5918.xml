<TITLE>SWISSAIR JANUARY TRAFFIC UP, REVENUE DOWN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Swissair &lt;SWSZ.Z&gt; said its overall load
factor for January was steady at 58 pct compared to the same
period a year ago. Its seat load factor dipped to 58 pct in
January from 59 pct in 1986.
    A six pct rise in overall traffic in the month came on
tonne-km capacity eight pct higher than a year ago.
    Cargo traffic in the month was 10 pct higher than a year
earlier and passenger traffic was up five pct, but unfavourable
currency rates led to an eight pct fall in revenue.
    Costs before depreciation were down nine pct in the month.
