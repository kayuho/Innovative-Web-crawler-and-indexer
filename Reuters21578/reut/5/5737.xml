<TITLE>ATCOR &lt;ATCO&gt; SAYS OUTLOOK DEPENDS ON STEEL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Atcor Inc said the magnitude of any
earnings recovery in fiscal 1987 depends on the direction of
steel pricing and how fast the company's severe operating
problems in its consumer segment are resolved.
    Atcor's consumer segment represents about 25 pct of its
sales. In a letter to shareholders the company said that that
part of its business continues to be unprofitable.
    Atcor said it does not expect performance improvements in
the first quarter to be sustained throughout the year due to
increasing raw material costs.
