<TITLE>CANBRA FOODS SETS SPECIAL FIVE DLR/SHR PAYOUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LETHBRIDGE, Alberta, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Canbra Foods Ltd&gt;, earlier
reporting a 1986 net profit against a year-ago loss, said it
declared a special, one-time dividend of five dlrs per common
share, pay March 31, record March 26.
    Canbra said it set the special payout to allow shareholders
to participate in the gain on the sale of unit Stafford Foods
Ltd in November, 1986, as well as the company's "unusually
profitable performance" in 1986.
    Canbra earlier reported 1986 net earnings of 4.2 mln dlrs,
excluding a 1.3 mln dlr gain on the Stafford sale, compared to
a year-ago loss of 1.5 mln dlrs.
