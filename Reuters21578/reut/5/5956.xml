<TITLE>LUKENS &lt;LUC&gt; SAYS BACKLOG HIGHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    COATESVILLE, Pa., March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lukens Inc said its backlog at
the end of February was about 140 mln dlrs, up from 104 mln
dlrs at the end of 1986 and more than 50 pct above the February
1986 level.
    The company said "Based upon the current backlog, we are
reasonably confident that sales in the first two quarters will
be stronger than sales in the same two quarters last year.
Earnings from operations should also be better."  Lukens earned
456,000 dlrs in last year's first quarter and 2,500,000 dlrs in
the second quarter, excluding a pension gain and a litigation
provision in that period.
    Lukens had first quarter sales last year of 92.9 mln dlrs
and second quarter sales of 105.9 mln dlrs.
