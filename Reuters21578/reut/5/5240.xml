<TITLE>SWEDISH INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION FALLS IN JANUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sweden's industrial production fell
1.8 pct during January compared with a fall of 0.8 pct the
month before and remains unchanged compared with January 1986,
according to figures from the Central Bureau of Statistics.
    The bureau attributed the fall to a long Christmas break
and particularly cold weather, which lowered production in the
forestry industry.
