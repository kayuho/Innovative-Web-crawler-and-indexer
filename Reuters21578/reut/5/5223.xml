<TITLE>U.K. MONEY MARKET OFFERED EARLY ASSISTANCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it invited an
early round of bill offers from discount houses after
forecasting a shortage in the system of some 1.05 billion stg.
    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
in official hands and treasury bill take-up will drain some
1.07 billion stg while exchequer transactions will take out
around 335 mln stg and bankers' balances below target five mln
stg.
    Partly offseting these outflows, a fall in note circulation
will add some 355 mln stg to the system today.
