<TITLE>NEGOTIATORS DRAFT DETAILS OF NEXT RUBBER PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rubber producers and consumers, who
agreed last week on the central elements of a new international
natural rubber pact, have started work on the legal drafting of
a future accord, delegates said.

United Nations conference on an accord to replace the current
pact, which expires in October.
