<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan intervened in the
market, buying a moderate amount of dollars around 137.80-85
yen, dealers said.

directly buying dollars against marks, after reports that it
intervened through the Bank of Japan in the morning.
    The dollar moved up on short-covering aided by the central
bank intervention, they said.
