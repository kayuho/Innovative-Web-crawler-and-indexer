<TITLE>SEARS &lt;S&gt; RESTRUCTURES BUSINESS SYSTEMS CENTERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sears Roebuck and Co said it will
restructure its business systems centers, which sell computer
systems.
    The restructuring reflects the changing personal computer
market, Sears said.
    Sears will consolidate 41 business systems center outlets
in markets where it has more than one sales facility.
    Sales and support staffs will remain intact and will report
to a single location in most metropolitan areas.
    When the consolidation is complete, Sears will operate 59
computer centers in 51 markets nationwide.
    Some 31 markets with single sales offices will not be
affected.
    "We no longer need as many sales locations in each market
because our sales organization will be calling directly upon
our customers at their places of business," explained John H.
Rollins, national manager of Sears Business Systems Centers.
