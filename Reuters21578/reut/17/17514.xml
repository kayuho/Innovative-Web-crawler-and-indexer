<TITLE>SMITHKLINE &lt;SKB&gt;, BOEHRINGER FINALIZE PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PHILADELPHIA, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>SmithKline Beckman Corp said it and
&lt;Boehringer Mannheim GmbH&gt; signed a final agreement to develop
and market new cardiovascular medicines discovered by
Boehringer.
    Under the agreement, SmithKline said, it will have
responsibility for developing the products in the U.S. Both
partners will market the products in the U.S. and abroad.
    Initially, SmithKline said, the companies will concentrate
on the clinical development and marketing of carvedilol which
is a compound to treat mild to moderate hypertension and
angina.
   
    An application for marketing approval of carvedilol was
submitted in West Germany last December, SmithKline said.
Applications expected in other European markets this year and
submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is
projected for 1990.
    It said work also underway on thromboxane receptor
antagonists, compounds which could be useful in accelerating
disolution of blood clots and preventing blod clots from
occuring in a heart attack as well as in other arterial
diseases. The company said two of these compounds are in
clinical evaluation in Europe and the U.S.
