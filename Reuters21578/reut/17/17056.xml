<TITLE>DENMARK'S NOVO INDUSTRI GETS SWISS SHARE LISTING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    COPENHAGEN, April 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Danish-based insulin and enzymes
producer Novo Industri A/S &lt;NVO.CO&gt; said in a statement that
its "B" shares would be listed on stock exchanges in Zurich,
Basel and Geneva from May 4.
    The aim is to create broader European interest in Novo
stock, currently listed in Copenhagen, London and New York,
said the statement issued after yesterday's ordinary general
meeting.
    Novo said more than 50 pct of its B shares were owned by
U.S. Investors. The new listings, the first by a Danish company
on the Swiss exchanges, will not involve issuing of new share
capital.
