<TITLE>BANK OF JAPAN INTERVENES IN TOKYO BUYING DOLLARS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan intervened buying
dollars shortly after the opening of 137.70 yen, dealers said.
    Strong selling from life insurance companies and investment
trusts pressured the dollar downward, but the U.S. Unit
steadied on profit-taking buying by petroleum companies and
intervention by the central bank.
    The dollar's upward potential looks limited as forward
dollar selling by exporters for commercial purposes is expected
above 137.80, dealers said.
