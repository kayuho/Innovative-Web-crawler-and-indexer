<TITLE>BORDEN &lt;BN&gt; TO ACQUIRE MAJOR PASTA MAKER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YROK, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Borden Inc said it is acquiring &lt;Prince
Co Inc&gt; and three companies producing grocery products for 180
mln dlrs.
    Borden said the four companies are expected to have 1987
sales totaling 230 mln dlrs.
    It said Prince, a Lowell, Mass., producer of pasta and
Italian food sauces, is expected to account for 210 mln dlrs of
this total. This year's sales of Borden pasta -- by the 13
regional brands and the premium Creamette brand distributed on
a nearly national basis -- are expected to toal 285 mln dlrs,
it said.
    Borden said the other three companies being acquired are
Steero Bouillon of Jersey City, N.J., Blue Channel Inc, a
Beaufort, S.C., producer of canned crabmeat, and the canned
shrimp products line of DeJean Packing Inc of Biloxi, Miss.
    Borden also said the divestment of three operations with
about 50 mln dlrs a year in sales is expected to produce nearly
45 mln dlrs in cash for use toward the purchase of new
businesses.
    It said the sale of Polyco of Cincinnati, Ohio, which makes
polyvinyl acetate emulsions, to Rohm and Haas Co &lt;ROH&gt; was
announced by the buyer last month.
   
    Borden said the divestment of two producers of toy models
and hobby items -- Heller in France and Humbrol in England --
is in process.
