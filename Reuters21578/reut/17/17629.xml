<TITLE>NIGERIA HOSTS TALKS ON AFRICAN ECONOMIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LAGOS, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>A conference to assess the economic
recovery of African states begins in the proposed Nigerian
capital Abuja on June 15, Foreign Ministry officials said
today.
    Organised by Nigeria in collaboration with the Economic
Commission for Africa, the June 15-19 conference would be
attended by several African leaders as well as United Nations
Secretary General Perez De Cuellar, they said.
    Huge debts, falling prices of their export commodities and
in some cases drought have imposed severe hardships on the
economies of African states.
