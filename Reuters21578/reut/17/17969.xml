<TITLE>RAINIER REALTY &lt;RRETS.O&gt; NOTE INTEREST RAISED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEATTLE, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rainier Realty Investors said Rainier
Bancorp &lt;RBANK.O&gt; has agreed to increase the interest rate on
the notes the bank would offer in connection with the trust's
proposed liquidation to 8-1/4 pct from eight pct.

compensate for a recent rise in interest rates.  It said
shareholders will continue to have the option of taking 9.14
dlrs in cash for each of their shares, rather than seven-year
Rainier notes with a principal value of 10 dlrs.  Shareholders
weill vote on the proposal at a special meeting to be held July
