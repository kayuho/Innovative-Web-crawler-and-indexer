<TITLE>MEES NEWSLETTER SAYS OMAN OFFERS OIL DISCOUNTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     NICOSIA, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Oman has granted term crude oil
customers retroactive discounts from official prices of 30 to
38 cents per barrel on liftings made during February, March and
April, the weekly newsletter Middle East Economic Survey (MEES)
said.
     MEES said the price adjustments, arrived at through
negotiations between the Omani oil ministry and companies
concerned, are designed to compensate for the difference
between market-related prices and the official price of 17.63
dlrs per barrel adopted by non-OPEC Oman since February.
