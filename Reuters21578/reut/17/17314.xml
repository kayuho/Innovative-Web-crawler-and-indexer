<TITLE>BALLADUR DEFENDS CGCT DECISION ON ERICSSON</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MILAN, April 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur
said the government awarded control of &lt;Compagnie Generale de
Constructions Telephonques&gt; (CGCT) to a consortium headed by
Sweden's AB LM Ericsson &lt;ERIC.ST&gt; last week because its
proposal was "judged technically sound and valid."
    Balladur, responding to a question following a speech
before the Milan Chamber of Commerce, said the successful bid
by Ericsson and French partners Matra &lt;MATR.PA&gt; and &lt;Banque
Indosuez&gt; was "well organised and equipment will be readily
available." He did not comment further.
    CGCT has 16 pct of France's telephone switching market.
