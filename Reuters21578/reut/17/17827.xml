<TITLE>DEKALB &lt;DKLBB.O&gt; SELLS HEINOLD HOG MARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DEKALB, Ill., June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dekalb Corp said it sold its Heinold
Hog Market Inc to the unit's employees through an Employee
Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).
    Terms were not disclosed, but president Bruce Bickner said
the sale will have a positive, but not substantial, impact on
DeKalb as a whole.
    The company said the hog marketing unit did not fit with
its strategy of investing in its core businesses.
