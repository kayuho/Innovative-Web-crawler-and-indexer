<TITLE>KENYA'S TEA AND COFFEE AREAS CONTINUE DRY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NAIROBI, April 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kenya's coffee and tea growing areas
remained generally dry for the second consecutive week, in the
period to April 28, weather and farming sources said.
    All areas east and west of the Rift Valley recorded below
25 mm of rain with western Kericho town having only 21 mm, they
said. Kericho, which last year received 387 mm in April last
year, has so far recorded only 176 mm and little rain is
forecast throughout the country in the next two days.
    Tea and coffee crops are doing well but farmers fear that
output will be low if the unusually dry spell continues. April
is normally the wettest month in Kenya.
