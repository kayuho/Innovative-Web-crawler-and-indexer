<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>A subsidiary of the Japanese
construction group Kumagai Gumi Co Ltd &lt;KUMT.TOK&gt; is seeking to
float its shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, merchant
banking sources said.
    They said &lt;Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong) Ltd&gt; has appointed
&lt;Canadian Eastern Finance Ltd&gt;, &lt;Sun Hung Kai International
Ltd&gt; and &lt;Wardley Ltd&gt; as arrangers for the flotation. But they
declined disclosure of any further details.

pct stake in Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong).
    He said the privately held &lt;Li Ka-shing Foundations Ltd&gt;
will receive a certain number of shares in Kumagai Gumi (Hong
Kong) for injection into the company and up to 50 pct interest
in a 520 mln H.K. Dlr worth property project at Hong Kong's New
Territories.
    But he added the Cheung Kong group will have no interest in
the construction firm.
