<TITLE>BUNDESBANK BOUGHT DOLLARS FOR YEN IN OPEN MARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank intervened in the open
market to buy dollars for yen ahead of the Frankfurt fixing,
dealers said.
    They said the Bundesbank bought dollars for around 139.80
yen in small amounts in the half-hour running up to the 1100
GMT fix.
    The Bundesbank did not intervene when the dollar was fixed
in Frankfurt at 1.7969 marks.
    Earlier the Bank of Japan bought dollars steadily in the
Far East, but could not stop heavy selling which pushed the
dollar to a post-war low of 139.05 yen at one point.
