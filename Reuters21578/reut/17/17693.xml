<DATELINE>    ANAHEIM, Calif., June 1- </DATELINE><BODY>General Electric Co said it and
Alsthom of France are developing a 200 megawatt gas turbine
that will be the most powerful combustion turbine in the world,

    The company said when used in a combined cycle application,
the power plant efficiency will exceed 50 pct.

codeveloper and comanufacturer of the first unit.
    GE said the first of the turbines will be installed for
