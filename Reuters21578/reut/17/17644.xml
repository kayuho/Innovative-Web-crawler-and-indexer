<TITLE>DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIES (DMC) TO SELL UNITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ST. LOUIS, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Diversified Industries Inc plans to
recover more than four mln dlrs from the sale of two marginal
subsidiaries, chairman Ben Fixman told the annual meeting.
    Fixman said Diversified Industries, as part of its effort
to redeploy assets, wants to sell its Theodore Sall Inc and
Liberty Smelting Works (1962) Ltd units. The two either lost
money or had marginal profitability in recent years, he said.
    Diversified also said it is in the process of obtaining six
mln dlrs in an industrial revenue bond financing from the State
of Connecticut to modernize the company's Plume and Atwood
Brass Mill plant in Thomaston, Conn.
