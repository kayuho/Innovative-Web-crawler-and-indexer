<TITLE>HARCOURT &lt;HBJ&gt; HAS NO COMMENT ON SUIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc said it
has no comment at this time on the lawsuit filed against it by
British publisher Robert Maxwell.
    In the suit, Maxwell's British Printing and Communication
Corp is attempting to stop Harcourt's payment of a 40 dlr per
share special dividend and other actions.
    Harcourt announced its recapitalization plan to escape a
hostile bid by Maxwell. Maxwell last week withdrew his 44 dlr
per share or two billion dlr bid because of the plan.
