<TITLE>IRAN SAYS IT WILL COMBAT GULF INTERVENTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ABU DHABI, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iranian foreign minister Ali Akbar
Velayati warned that Iran would combat any superpower
intervention in the Gulf.
    "Iran, which is the most powerful (country) in the Gulf...
Will not allow the superpowers or any other foreign forces to
interfere in the region," he said.
    Velayati, visiting the United Arab Emirates on the first
leg of a Gulf tour, told reporters Iran had the "capabilities
and means" to prevent any interference. President Reagan has
pledged to keep the Gulf sealanes open and to protect Kuwaiti
tankers from possible Iranian attack.
