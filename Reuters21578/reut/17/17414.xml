<TITLE>REUTERS &lt;RTRSY.O&gt; SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE CHANGES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Reuters Holdings PLC said shareholders
approved changes in the company's articles of association to
allow it to seek a listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
    The shareholders also approved a stock option plan tied to
performance. The plan allows grants of options up to eight
times earnings to a small group of executives, the company
said.
    The shareholders approved the measures at a special meeting
following the company's annual meeting.
    The amendment allowing the Tokyo listing exempts the &lt;Japan
Securities Clearing Corp&gt; from a 15 pct shareholding limit
contained in the articles of association.
    Under rules of the Tokyo exchange, shares in foreign
companies owned by Japanese must be registered in the name of
Japan Securities Clearing or its nominee, the company said.
    Reuters, based in London, supplies a wide range of
information services to business and news media subscribers.
