<TITLE>SPAIN APPROVES AID FUNDS FOR STEEL INDUSTRY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, April 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Spanish cabinet agreed a 223.33
billion peseta aid package for the steel industry to restore
the sector to profitability by 1989, Industry Minister Luis
Carlos Croissier said.
    He told reporters at a news conference the money would be
shared among four state and privately-owned mills, which now
operate at a loss.
    The funds will be used to help modernise the industry,
increase productivity and cut production to 17.5 mln tonnes a
year from a current capacity of 18.2 mln tonnes.
