<TITLE>CHINA FOREST FIRES FLARE AGAIN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Forest fires in north-east China had

untouched by the blaze, the official press said.

discovered in the Inner Mongolia region and were rapidly
spreading north and west. It said rain forecast for the region
was expected to help contain them.

camps. Soldiers have been called in to fight the blaze.
