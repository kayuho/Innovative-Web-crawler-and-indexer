<TITLE>SEABROOK NUCLEAR STATION OWNERS SET ADVERTISING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEABROOK, N.H., June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Public Service Co of New Hampshire
&lt;PNH&gt; said the owners of the Seabrook nuclear power plant
approved a 1.2 mln dlr advertising campaign to inform the
public about the plant's safe construction.
    The campaign make a point that nuclear power provides
one-third of New England's electricity and Seabrook is the
ninth nuclear plant in the six-state region.
    Operation of the plant has been delayed by the reluctance
of officials in neighboring Massachusets to participate in
evacuation drills. New Hampshire Public Service is operator of
the plant and has a 35.6 pct interest in the facility.
