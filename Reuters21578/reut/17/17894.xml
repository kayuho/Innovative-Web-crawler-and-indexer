<TITLE>MALAYSIAN RUBBER OUTPUT RECOVERS FROM WINTERING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Malaysian rubber production should
return to normal levels this month after a hard wintering
season, the Malaysian Rubber Exchange and Licensing Board said
in its latest review. "As packers and remillers expect
production to recover to normal levels in June, sellers will
remain reserved in the near future," the review, dated May 14,
said. Many consumers are holding off, waiting for the best time
to buy.
    The market is mindful of approaching summer holidays in
industrial countries and there is an air of uncertainty beyond
July, it said. It gave no figures for the output drop.
