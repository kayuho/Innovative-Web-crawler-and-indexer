<TITLE>MEXICO YET TO REPLY TO PERU'S SILVER INVITATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MEXICO CITY, April 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mexico's minister of energy and
mines, Alfredo del Mazo, has yet to reply to a Peruvian
invitation for ministerial-level talks on bilateral cooperation
in silver marketing, a ministry spokesman said.
    Peruvian officials said they extended the invitation
earlier this week and that it was possible the talks could be
held within the next 15 days.
    Meanwhile, a Banco de Mexico spokesman confirmed that
Mexican central bank head Miguel Mancera Aguayo held private
talks here yesterday with the president of the Peruvian central
bank.
    The spokesman said the talks were in line with mutual
consultation agreements made during Peruvian President Alan
Garcia's visit to Mexico in march.
    Press reports citing diplomatic sources at the meeting said
the two central bank heads discussed means of coordinating
actions in the silver market.
    Mexico is the world's leading silver produer. It produced
about 73.9 mln troy ounces in 1986, according to preliminary
government figures.
    Peru, the second biggest producer of the precious metal,
earlier this week froze new silver sales in an effort to
stabilize silver prices. It produced 57 mln troy ounces in
1986.
