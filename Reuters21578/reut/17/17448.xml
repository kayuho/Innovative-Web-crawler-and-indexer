<TITLE>BUNDESBANK REPORTED TO HAVE NO PLAN FOR RATE CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bundesbank Deputy President Helmut
Schlesinger said the West German central bank had no plan to
cut its three pct discount rate, Nihon Keizai newspaper
reported.
    The financial daily quoted Schlesinger as saying in an
interview that the bank would try to maintain current interest
rate levels for the time being.
    He also told the newspaper he saw no need for large-scale
intervention in the foreign exchange market because exchange
rates are stable.
     Earlier, Schlesinger told a press conference that the
Bundesbank would continue its policy of maintaining short-term
interest rates at a low level for currency stability.
    He also said he was satisfied with the current dollar/mark
exchange rate but added that he was not certain if it was ideal
for the West German economy.
