<TITLE>SRI LANKAN TEA WORKERS LAUNCH ONE-DAY PROTEST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    COLOMBO, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thousands of tea workers of Indian origin
went on strike today to press demands for citizenship and
voting rights in Sri Lanka, a union statement said.
    The Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) said its 400,000 members
launched a prayer campaign at temples and other places in a
non-violent protest to get the authorities to expedite
citizenship procedures.
    A CWC spokesman said a three-day campaign was suspended
after a Cabinet committee promised to speed up procedures under
a new set of regulations. Trade sources said the strike did not
affect production or today's Colombo auction.
