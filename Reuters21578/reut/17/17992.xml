<TITLE>NYSE TO SUSPEND AND DELIST WEDTECH &lt;WDT&gt; ISSUES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The New York Stock Exchange said it
would suspend trading in Wedtech Corp's common stock, 13 pct
convertible subordinated debentures due on June 15, 2004 and 14
pct senior subordinated notes, due August 15, 1996 before
the opening of trading on June 16.
    Following suspension, the exchange said an application will
be made to the Securities and Exchange Commission to delist the
issues.
   
    The exchange said the action was taken in view of Wedtech's
unsatisfactory financial condition which it said the company
disclosed on April 23 and because it believed Wedtech was
unable to transfer its listing to another securities
martketplace.
    The exchange said it may at any time suspend a security if
it believes that continued dealings in the security on the
exchange are not advisable.
