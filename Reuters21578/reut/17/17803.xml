<TITLE>MYERS TO HEAD U.S. PARTY TO WORLD FOOD COUNCIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Peter Myers, Deputy Secretary of
Agriculture will head the U.S. delegation to the World Food
Council's Thirteenth Ministerial in Peking, China June 8-11,
the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    The discussions will center on four issues -- the global
state of hunger and malnutrition and the impact of economic
adjustment on food and hunger problems, the impact of
international agricultural trade and related national policies
on food and development, regional cooperation in food and
agriculture among developing nations in the Southern
hemisphere, and activities of multilateral assistance agencies
aimed at reducing hunger.
    The World Food Council is a 36-country United Nations body,
which recommends how governments and international
organizations can work together to alleviate world hunger.
