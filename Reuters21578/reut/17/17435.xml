<DATELINE>    NASHVILLE, TENN., May 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hospital Corp of America said it
received financing commitments of about 1.9 billion dlrs to pay

by the company's board of directors today.
    Under the reorganization, Hospital Corp will spin off over
100 hospitals to a new, independent firm for 1.8 billion dlrs

which will be owned by an employee stock ownership plan, ESOP.
    Hospital Corp said that Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc has

    This financing will comprise 270 mln dlrs of senior
