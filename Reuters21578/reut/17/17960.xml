<TITLE>CAROLCO &lt;CRC&gt; MAY BID FOR LIEBERMAN &lt;LMAN.O&gt;</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lieberman Enterprises Inc said
Carolco Pictures Inc is negotiating for the acquisition of the
50 pct of Lieberman shares held by the families of chairman
David Lieberman and president Harold Okinow at 20.50 dlrs each,
and if the deal were concluded, public shareholders would be
offered the same price for their shares.
    Lieberman said the Carolco bid to its public shareholders
would be in cash or shareholders could be offered securities as
an alternative. The offer would occur within about 90 days
after the closing of the sale of the initial 50 pct stake, the
company said.
    The company said a final agreement has not yet been reached
on the first transaction, but negotiations are expected to be
concluded in early June. Present management is expected to
continue to operate Lieberman, the company said. Lieberman
distributes prerecorded music, video movies and other products.
