<TITLE>BRAZIL NOT SELLING TO COCOA BUFFER STOCK - TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil is not selling cocoa beans
to the International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, buffer stock, as
spot prices for beans in the interior area are 20 to 25 pct
higher than levels which would be paid by the ICCO buffer stock
manager, trade sources in the major producing state Bahia said.
    The scarcity of beans because of the effects of drought on
the current temporao harvest has pushed prices well above
international levels, the sources noted.
    The only buyers are bean exporters or local processors
covering previously contracted commitments, they added.
    If sales were made they would be executed by individual
exporting companies which are members of the Brazilian Cocoa
Trade Commission, they said.
