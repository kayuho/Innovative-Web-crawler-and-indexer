<TITLE>REAGAN URGES FULFILLMENT OF EXCHANGE ACCORDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan, preparing to depart
for the Venice economic summit on Wednesday, said the United
States and its allies must fulfill agreements on exchange rate
stability.
    "Economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo, and at
this year's meetings of Group of 7 Finance ministers in Paris
and in Washington, cannot be ignored or forgotten," he said.
    "The commitments made at these meetings need to be
translated into action," Reagan said in a pre-summit speech
celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Marshall Plan.
