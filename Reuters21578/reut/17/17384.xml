<TITLE>EC UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS BELOW 17 MLN IN MARCH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, April 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Unemployment in the European
Community fell in March to 16.8 mln from 17 mln in February
thanks to an improvement in the weather, the EC's statistics
agency Eurostat said.
    It said the number of jobless fell in all 12 Community
member states as weather conditions improved, though France,
Italy and Spain saw declines of less than one pct.
    There was also a particularly large drop in the number of
jobless under-25s in all states except Italy, where 19,300 more
young people were unemployed in March than in the month before.
