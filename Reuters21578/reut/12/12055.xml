<TITLE>ARGENTINE CORN SALES TO USSR LOWER - USDA REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Total corn sales by Argentina to the
Soviet Union are only 1.5 to 1.8 mln tonnes, with delivery
spread out from March to June, the U.S. Agriculture
Department's Counselor in Buenos Aires said in a field report.
    The report, dated March 27, said many sources have stated
that the Soviet Union was initially interested in purchasing
2.3 mln tonnes lof corn from Argentina.
    However, Soviet purchases from the United States have
tended to displace additional Argentine purchases, the report
said.
    The USDA has to date reported USSR purchases of 2.6 mln
tonnes of U.S. corn for delivery in the current U.S.-USSR grain
agreement year, which ends this September 30, it said.
