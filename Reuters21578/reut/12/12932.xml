<TITLE>AEQUITRON &lt;AQTN&gt; SELLS LAND FOR 1.8 MLN DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Aequitron Medical Inc said that
&lt;Vantage Properties Inc&gt; has exercised its option to buy 15.3
acres of land from Aequitron for 1.8 mln dlrs.
    Aequitron orginally gave Vantage the option in May 1986 in
exchange for a 100,000 dlr letter of credit, which will be
forfeit if Vantage does not close the deal by April 30,
Aequitron said.
    Aequitron added it expects the deal to close on or before
April 30, its fiscal year-end.
    The company said it could realize a gain of about 300,000
dlrs on the sale, which will be used to reduce short term debt.
