<TITLE>SPAIN RAISES CALL MONEY RATE TO 14.5 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Spain said it raised its rate
for overnight call money to 14.5 pct from 14 pct with immediate
effect at today's daily auction for assistance funds.
    The move followed comments yesterday by central bank
governor Mariano Rubio, who said money supply growth was too
fast.
    The bank said later that it was leaving its rate for
special assistance funds from its second window unchanged at 16
pct, surprising operators who had expected an increase there
too.
