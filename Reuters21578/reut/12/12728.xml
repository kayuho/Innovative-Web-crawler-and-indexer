<TITLE>COOPER BASIN NATURAL GAS RESERVES UPGRADED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ADELAIDE, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Remaining recoverable gas reserves in
the areas held by the Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S&gt;-led Cooper Basin
joint ventures have been upgraded to 2,721.7 billion cubic feet
(bcf) from the 2,466 estimated last May, Santos said.
    The upgrading followed a re-review by consultant &lt;Coles
Nikiforuk Pennell Associates&gt; in light of the large number of
gas finds since May 1986, Santos said in a statement.
    This means that total contractual commitments of 2,455.5
bcf to &lt;The Australian Gas Light Co&gt; of New South Wales and the
Pipeline Authority of South Australia can be met with spare gas
available for sale in South Australia, it said.
