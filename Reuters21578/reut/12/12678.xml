<TITLE>ALCATEL TO RESTRUCTURE SPANISH SUBSIDIARIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Alcatel NV&gt;, the telecommunications
venture set up by ITT Corp &lt;ITT&gt; and France's &lt;Cie Generale
d'Electricite&gt;, has accepted a proposal from the Industry
Ministry to restructure ITT's former Spanish subsidiary,
&lt;Standard Electrica SA&gt;, a Standard spokesman said.
    He said Alcatel also has agreed to sell &lt;Marconi Espanola
SA&gt;, owned 80 pct by Standard and 20 pct by Alcatel.
    Negotiations to put Standard on a sounder financial footing
have involved the government, Alcatel and Spain's telephone
company, Compania Telefonica Nacional de Espana SA &lt;TELF.MA&gt;,
which has a small stake in Standard and is its main customer.
