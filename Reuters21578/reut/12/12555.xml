<TITLE>EC TO BOOST SPENDING ON JOB CREATION THIS YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community (EC) is to boost
spending to help the jobless this year.
    The EC's executive commission said in a statement spending
on its so-called social fund would rise to 3.1 billion European
Currency Units from 2.5 billion ECUs in 1986. The fund is
designed to help boost job creation and improve worker
mobility, and supplement national schemes in the EC's 12 member
states.
    Another 60 mln ECUs could be added if EC ministers switch
unused project credits to other programs, the Commission said.
    Italy is the largest net beneficiary in 1987, getting 635
mln ECUs, with Britain in second place with 580 mln.
