<TITLE>TREASURY'S BAKER BACKS HOUSE PANEL'S FSLIC BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
the administration backs the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corp (FSLIC) recapitalization bill approved by the House
Banking Committee and opposes the Senate-passed version.
    Baker told a House Appropriations Subcommittee the 15
billion dlr recapitalization plan approved by the House panel
was sufficient while the 7.5 billion dlr plan in the
Senate-passed bill was "inadequate."
    He also urged the House to reject loophole-closing
provisions in the Senate bill that would restrict banking
activities.
