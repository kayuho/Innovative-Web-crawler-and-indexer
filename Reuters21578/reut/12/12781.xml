<TITLE>GEC WINS ROBOTS ORDER FROM USSR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The General Electric Co Plc &lt;GECL.L&gt; said
its Electrical Projects division had won an initial 2.5 mln stg
order to supply robots to the Soviet motor industry.
    Eighteen paint-spraying robots will be installed at the Gaz
truck and car plant in Gorky, GEC said in a statement. If the
factory standardised on the GEC product, further orders for up
to 80 more robots could be expected, it added.
    Division engineering director Alan Davies said he expects
further agreements soon with the Soviet machine tool and
chemical equipment industries. These would cover the part
manufacture of 100 to 200 GEC robots per year in the USSR.
