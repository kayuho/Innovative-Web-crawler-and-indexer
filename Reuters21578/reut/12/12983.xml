<TITLE>U.S., CANADA SWITCH TO DAYLIGHT TIME SUNDAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States switches to
daylight saving time on Sunday, April 5, when clocks will be
turned ahead one hour at 0200 in all time zones.
    The states of Arizona and Hawaii and parts of Indiana,
including Indianapolis, remain on standard time by local
choice.
    Congress voted last year to move the start of daylight time
from the last Sunday in April to the first Sunday in April. The
return to standard time remains the last Sunday in October
(October 25 this year).
    Canada also switches to daylight time on Sunday.
