<TITLE>BANGOR HYDRO-ELECTRIC &lt;BANG&gt; GETS APPROVAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANGOR, Maine, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bangor Hydro-Electric Co said the
Maine PUblic Utilities Commission approved changes in rates
effective today that will decrease revenues by about 412,000
dlrs or 0.5 pct.
    The decrease results from changes in the base rates and in
the fuel cost adjustment rate charged by the company.
    Base rates will decrease by 6.25 mln dlrs due largely to
its sale in the Seabrook nuclear power project, a reduction in
federal income taxes and lower costs of capital.
    The base rate assumes a rate of return of 11.57 pct, down
from 13.1 pct. Offsetting the decrease, however, is an
authorization to increase fuel rates by 5.84 mln dlrs, it said.
