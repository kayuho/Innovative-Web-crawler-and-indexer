<TITLE>THAI TRADERS OPPOSE REIMPOSITION OF COFFEE QUOTAS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thai coffee exporters said they hoped
the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) would not reimpose
export quotas even though this may lead to a further slump in
world prices.
    Susin Suratanakaweekul, president of the Thai Coffee
Exporters Association, told Reuters that Thailand obtained
little benefit from previous ICO quotas which represented only
about 30 pct of its total annual exports.
    Thailand expects increased overall coffee export revenue if
there are no restrictions on sales to current ICO members who
offer higher prices than non-members, he said.
    The Customs Department said Thailand exported 21,404 tonnes
of coffee last year, up from 20,602 in 1985.
    Thai coffee production is projected to fall to about 25,000
tonnes in the 1986/87 (Oct/Sept) season from 28,000 the
previous year.
    However, a senior Commerce Ministry official said the Thai
government supports coffee producers' lobbying for reimposed
ICO quotas which, he said, would help lift world prices.
    Somphol Kiatpaiboon, director general of the Commercial
Economics Department, said an absence of ICO quotas would
encourage producers to rapidly release coffee on to the market,
further depressing prices.
    He said Indonesia is expected to export a substantial
amount of coffee this month without such restrictions.
