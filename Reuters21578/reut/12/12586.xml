<TITLE>FLORIDA INVESTMENT FIRM SHUT BY SEC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MIAMI, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) had Elliott Enterprises, an investment firm in Naples,
Fla., shut down, accusing it of defrauding investors and
misusing funds.
    An SEC spokesman in Miami said the agency closed the
investment holding company and two related firms, Elliott
Securities and Elliott Mortgage Co.

closed, appointed a receiver and froze the assets of the firm's
executives.
