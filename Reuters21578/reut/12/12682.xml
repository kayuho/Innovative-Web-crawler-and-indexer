<TITLE>PACIFIC FIRST &lt;PFFS&gt; SEES HIGHER 1ST QTR NET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TACOMA, Wash., April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pacific First Financial Corp said
it expects to report a sharp increase in first quarter earnings
as compared to the 4.1 mln dlrs, or 54 cts per share, reported
a year earlier.
    The company also said earnings for the quarter should
exceed the record 7.9 mln dlrs, or 1.05 dlrs per share,
reported in last year's final quarter.
    The gains will be due to strong net interest income and
profits on the sale of certain mortgage loans and mortgage
backed securities, Pacific First said. The company expects to
report first quarter results the week of April 13.
