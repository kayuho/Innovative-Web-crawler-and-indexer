<TITLE>HOOGOVENS EXPECTS CLEAR LOSS IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     IJMUIDEN, The Netherlands, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Koninklijke
Nederlandsche Hoogovens en Staalfabrieken NV&gt; said it expected
a "clear loss" for 1987.
     The company reported its 1986 profits were 44 pct lower at
154.6 mln guilders than in the year before.
     Turnover was 18 pct lower than in 1985.
     The main reason fo the fall in turnover was the lower rate
of the dollar, the company said. The lower costs for raw
materials and energy, resulting from the lower dollar, could
not compensate the fall in revenues.
     Costs 5.61 billion guilders vs 6.66 billion
     Depreciation 457 mln vs 493 mln
     Operating profit 375 mln vs 598 mln
     Financial charges 155.1 mln vs 169.4 mln
     Extraordinary loss 12 rpt 12 mln vs 138 mln
     Crude steel production five mln tonnes vs 5.3 mln
     Aluminium production 96,000 tonnes vs same.
