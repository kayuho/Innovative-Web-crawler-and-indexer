<TITLE>BRITISH TELECOM &lt;BTY&gt; GIVES CTG TO MITEL &lt;MLT&gt;</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>British Telecommunications PLC has
transferred the information systems division of its wholly
owned Canadian subsidiary, CTG Inc, to 51-pct-owned Mitel Corp,
Mitel said.
    It said the transfer was designed to strengthen Mitel's
position in the Canadian market.
    British Telecom acquired 51 pct of Mitel in March, 1986,
while CTG became a wholly owned British Telecom subsidiary in
May, 1985.
    Mitel said the transfer of holdings represents a
restructuring of British Telecom's private branch exchange
(PBX) interests in Canada.
    It said the CTG unit will become the center of a newly
formed Mitel direct sales division, which will sell SX-2000
products to major Canadian business customers.
