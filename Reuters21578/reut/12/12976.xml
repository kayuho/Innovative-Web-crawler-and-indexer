<TITLE>CUSTOMS LEVIES BOND ON JAPANESE SHIPMENTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Customs Bureau has begun to levy
on bond on certain Japanese goods pending a final decision by
President Reagan on April 17 on imposing the planned 100 pct
tariff on the shipments, the bureau said.
    A bureau official said bonding began on March 31 and if the
penalties are imposed as expected after a period of comment,
they will retroactive to that date.
    The penalties are to be levied on variety of electronic
items in retaliation for Japan's failure to comply with a July
1986 agreement to end dumping semiconductors in third nations
and to open its home market to U.S. goods.
