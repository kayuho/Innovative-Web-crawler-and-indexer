<TITLE>MCDOWELL &lt;ME&gt; TO GET QUALIFIED AUDIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NASHVILLE, Tenn., April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>McDowell Enterprises Inc said
its auditors have decided to qualify their opinion on 1986
financial statements due to questions about the company's
ability to continue as a going concern.
    McDowell said it will file its annual report for 1986 by
April 15, after applying for an extension, and will report a
loss for the year of about six mln dlrs after a substantial
writedown of assets and an increase in costs associated with
its withdrawal from the construction business.
    In 1985, McDowell lost 2,152,000 dlrs before a 1,240,000
dlr loss from discontinued operations.
