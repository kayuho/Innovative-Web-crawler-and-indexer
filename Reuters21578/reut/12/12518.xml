<TITLE>BRITISH TELECOM TO SELL EQUIPMENT IN NORTH AMERICA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>British Telecommunications Plc &lt;BTY.L&gt;
will market electronic data transmission equipment of its own
design in North America, a spokesman said.
    The spokesman told Reuters the equipment, known as
fourth-generation modems, will be sold by &lt;Mitel Datacom Inc&gt;,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canada's Mitel Corp &lt;MLT.TO&gt;, in
which British Telecom has a controlling stake.
    He declined to comment on the volume of projected sales. He
said the modems, already available in Europe where they hold a
majority share of the market, were the first of their kind to
comply with the latest international standards.
