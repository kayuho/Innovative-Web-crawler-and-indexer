<TITLE>STOLTENBERG SEES NO "ITALIAN PROBLEM" AT G-7</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg said he foresaw no problem about Italian
participation in talks held by Group of Seven (G-7) Finance
Ministers and central bankers ahead of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting next week.
    Italy refused to join a G-7 meeting in Paris in February,
angered at not being invited to a prior working dinner of the
G-5 countries - U.S., U.K., West Germany, France and Japan.
    Stoltenberg told a news conference he saw no difficulties
about Italy joining the G-7 Washington talks, which he said
would be preceded by other informal and bilateral talks.
