<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Reynolds Metals Co is raising 200 mln
dlrs through an offering of convertible subordinated debentures
due 2012 with a six pct coupon and par pricing, said sole
manager Goldman, Sachs and Co.
    The debentures are convertible into the company's common
