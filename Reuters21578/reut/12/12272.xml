<TITLE>HYDRO-QUEBEC HEARINGS TO REOPEN IN OTTAWA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Montreal, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The National Energy Board said hearings
into Hydro-Quebec's request to sell power to the United States
will reopen in Ottawa April nine.
    The board heard nine days of testimony in Montreal after it
opened the hearings March 16.
    Hydro-Quebec is seeking an export license to sell 70
terawatt hours of electricity to the New England Power Pool, a
group of about 90 utilities, from the year 1990 to 2000. The
contract is valued at three billion Canadian dlrs. A terawatt
hour is the power consumed by a city of 100,000 people in one
year, or 70 billion kilowatt hours.
    The hearings are scheduled to last two days in Ottawa.
    After that, the board will begin its deliberations, which
could take as long as two months before a decision is reached.
