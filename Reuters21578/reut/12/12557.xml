<TITLE>JACOBS TAKES MAJORITY STAKE IN COTE D'OR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Jacobs Suchard AG said it acquired a
"comfortable majority" interest in its takeover bid for Cote d'Or
SA, Belgium's leading producer of chocolate.
    In a statement, Jacobs said it had acquired all the shares
tendered by the time its offer expired on March 30. The offer,
for 100 pct of Cote d'Or at 8,050 Belgian francs per ordinary
share, was agreed with the Belgian firm's board.
    A Jacobs spokesman declined to specify the size of the
majority stake and said Jacobs had not decided what it would do
about acquiring the outstanding shares.
