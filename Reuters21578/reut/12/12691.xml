<TITLE>EPA TO SHIELD WATER SUPPLY FROM GASOLINE LEAKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Environmental Protection Agency
proposed rules to shield water supplies from potential leaks
from 1.4 mln underground storage tanks, nearly half of which
are used to store gasoline at service stations.
    It said the rules would require owners and operators of the
tanks containing petroleum products or certain hazardous
chemicals to monitor the tanks for leaks and, in case of leaks,
to notify appropriate authorities.
    The owners and operators of petroleum tanks would also be
financially responsible for any contamination, the EPA said.
    It said financial requirements for chemical tanks will be
proposed later.
    Hazardous tanks are regulated separately.
    EPA Administrator Lee Thomas said "Thousands of underground
storage tanks are currently leaking and, without adequate
controls, many more can be expected to leak in the future,
endangering our nation's drinking-water supplies."
    He added in a statement "We intend to ensure that each
underground tank is either upgraded or closed down and that
safe operating and cleanup procedures are following to provide
maximum protection from any future leaks."
