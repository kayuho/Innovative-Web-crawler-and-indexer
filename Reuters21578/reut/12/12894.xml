<TITLE>AMC &lt;AMO&gt; TO INSPECT 20,000 VEHICLES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SOUTHFIELD, MICH., April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Motors Corp said it
will ask Jeep dealers to inspect about 20,000 Cherokee,
Wagoneer and Comanche vehicles equipped with 4.0-liter,
6-cylinder engines to determine whether the air control valve
for the fuel injection system is out of design tolerance.
    The company said it will seek about 5,000 affected
vehicles, all 1987 models, manufactured between Jan 15 and
March 3, 1987. It said the out-of-tolerance air valves may
prevent the engine speed from returning to idle when the
accelerator pedal is released, the company said.
