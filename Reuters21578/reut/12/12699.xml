<DATELINE>    KENT, Wash., April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pay 'N Pak Stores, which previously
announced plans to explore all alternatives for maximizing

assist it in exploring its alternatives.

could include downsizing its operations, a leveraged buyout or
a combination with a friendly merger partner.
