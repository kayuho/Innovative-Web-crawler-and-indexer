<TITLE>RESCUE WORKERS BRINGING MINERS FROM UNDERGROUND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MURDOCHVILLE, Quebec, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rescue workers are bringing
out miners who have been trapped in a &lt;Noranda Inc&gt;
copper mine for almost 24 hours by fire which has so far killed
one and sent 17 to hospital, company officials said.
    "We're working to take the men out - everybody that's
underground is safe, we're established contact with them and
now it's really just finding out how to take them out," Andre
Fortier, a vice president with Noranda Minerals, which owns the
mine said.
    Ange-Aime Kenny died after being trapped by smoke from the
fire, company officials said. Fortier said he believed all the
workers would be rescued by the end of the night. He said he
did not believe any of the 17 men taken to hospital were
seriously injured.
