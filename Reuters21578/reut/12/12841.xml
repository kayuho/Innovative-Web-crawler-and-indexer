<TITLE>BELGIAN MONEY SUPPLY RISES IN FOURTH QUARTER 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Belgian total money stock rose to
1,140.4 billion francs at the end of 1986 from 1,115.4 billion
at the end of the third quarter of last year and 1,055.0
billion at the end of 1985, Belgian National Bank figures
showed.
    Paper money rose to 404.1 billion francs from 394.1 billion
and 383.5 billion respectively, other forms of privately held
money to 679.5 billion from 652.7 billion and 616.0 billion.
    Money held by the public authorities fell to 56.8 billion
francs from 68.6 billion at the end of the previous quarter but
was above the 55.5 billion at the end of 1985, the bank said.
    The government does not set money supply targets, arguing
they are inappropriate to a small economy with major trading
and monetary links with much larger trading countries.
