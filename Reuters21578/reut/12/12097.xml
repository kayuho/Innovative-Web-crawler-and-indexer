<TITLE>NASD DENIES APPLICATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The National Association of
Securities Dealers Inc. denied Kirk Knapp's application to
become a registered member of the firm.
    NASD's board of governors said it denied the application of
Knapp to become registered with K.A. Knapp and Co, located in
Grand Rapids, Mich. The board said it based its decision on two
statutory disqualifications.
    In the first case, the board said it found Knapp failed to
maintain rquired net capital, filed inaccurate Focus Part 1
reports and inaccurately calculated the amount required to be
on deposit in the Special Reserve Account.
    The second case involved Knapp being enjoined from
violations of sections of the Securities Exchange Act, the NASD
said.
