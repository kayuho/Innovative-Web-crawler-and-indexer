<TITLE>UTILICORP &lt;UCU&gt; DIVISION CUTS GAS RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KANSAS CITY, Mo., April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Utilicorp United said the Iowa
Utilities Board has ordered its Peoples Natural Gas division to
reduce its rates to customers by 313,937 dlrs.
    Utilicorp said it will request a reconsideration of the
order within 20 days and the Board will have 20 days to act
upon the request.
    The company said the reduction was the result of a rate
request filed by Peoples in May 1986 for an 8.6 mln dlr
increase. The Board granted Peoples an interim increase of 4.2
mln dlrs in August 1986, Utilicorp said.
