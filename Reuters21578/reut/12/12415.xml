<TITLE>SUGAR OFFERED TO DUTCH INTERVENTION REFUSED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The 2,500 tonnes of sugar offered to
intervention in the Netherlands has been refused by the
intervention board because of wrong packaging, a spokeswoman
for the Ministry of Agriculture said.
    She said the sugar could be offered again to intervention.
    EC producers have threatened to sell over 800,000 tonnes of
sugar to intervention stocks as a protest against EC export
licensing policies.
    Last month Dutch traders said the sugar on offer in the
Netherlands was Belgian, but the ministry could not confirm
this.
