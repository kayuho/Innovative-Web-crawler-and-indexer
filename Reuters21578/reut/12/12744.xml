<TITLE>THATCHER PROSPECTS BOOSTED BY USSR TRIP, POLL SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
has improved her standing with voters, according to the first
opinion poll published since her return from the Soviet Union.
    Thatcher is seeking re-election for a third term and the
newspaper said there would now be pressure on her to go for a
June or even a May election to capitalise on her Soviet trip.
    The survey, by the Harris Research Centre for today's
London Daily News, said more than half of the 767 voters polled
by telephone believed she had improved the prospects of arms
reductions and peace while 22 pct said they were more likely to
vote for her now than before her visit.
    The poll was bad news for Labour opposition leader Neil
Kinnock. It showed that his popularity had slumped following
his trip to Washington last week to explain his anti-nuclear
policies. Thirty five pct of those polled said their opinion of
him had gone down since the trip and only 13 pct were more in
favour of him.
    In contrast, 46 pct said they were more impressed with
Thatcher after her trip to the Soviet Union. Only 14 pct rated
her less highly. REUTER
