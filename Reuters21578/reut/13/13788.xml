<TITLE>PORK BELLY FUTURES EXPECTED STEADY TO HIGHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pork belly futures were expected to open
steady to higher after yesterday's late strength and sharply
higher close in the nearby.
    Traders anticipate carryover demand prompted by steady to
mostly higher live hog calls and light hog runs. Slaughter is
likely to remain on the light side and lend support to cash
product, they said.
    Private reports of hedger interest for cash product also
prompted calls of steady to higher for cash bellies this
morning, they added.
    Guesses on today's out of town storage report ranged from
in 1.0 to 2.25 mln lbs.
