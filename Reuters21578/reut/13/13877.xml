<TITLE>BALL &lt;BLL&gt; TO SUPPLY PENNY BLANKS TO MINTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MUNCIE, IND., April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ball Corp said it was awarded a
one-year 12,750,000 dlr contract to supply copper-plated zinc
penny blanks to the U.S. mints in Philadelphia and Denver.
    The new contract, effective in June, calls for shipping
23,200,000 pounds of blanks to the mint in Philadelphia and

zinc from copper.
