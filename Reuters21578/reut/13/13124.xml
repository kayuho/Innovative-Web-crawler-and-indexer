<TITLE>HUTTON &lt;EFH&gt; STILL INTERESTED IN PUROLATOR &lt;PCC&gt;</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>E.F. Hutton LBO Inc is still interested
in an acquisition of Purolator Courier Corp, and is examining
the possibility of raising its 35 dlr per share offer, an E.F.
Hutton spokesman said.
    Hutton's offer was topped by a 40 dlr per share offer from
Emery Air Freight Corp &lt;EAF&gt; earlier this week.
    "We're definately not out of it at this point," the Hutton
spokesman said.
    "We want to see what the offer is completely and understand
it fully, and then fashion our response," the spokesman said.
    After Emery made its offer, Hutton extended the deadline on
its offer to Monday. The offer was to have expired Wednesday.
    Analysts said it might be difficult for Hutton to raise the
offer since Emery, an overnight courier, might have an easier
time justifying a lofty price since it would realize cost
savings by combining its business with those of Purolator.
    Purolator, a New Jersey-based overnight courier, has
declined comment.
    Purolator had traded above the Hutton offer price on
speculation a new bidder would emerge. It was up 1/8 today at
40-3/8, above the Emery offer.
