<TITLE>BRAZIL SEAMEN'S STRIKE ENDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Brazilian seamen's strike, which
began on February 27 and has been tapering off for weeks, has
now ended, a seamen's spokesman said.
    The spokesman said the seamen had signed an agreement with
the state-owned Lloyd Brasileiro company on Saturday for a 120
pct salary rise.
    The national strike had been tailing off since mid-March as
seamen struck individual accords with companies. At the height
of the stoppage, seamen said about 200 ships were strike-bound.
