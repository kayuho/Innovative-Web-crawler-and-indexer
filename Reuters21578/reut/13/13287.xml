<TITLE>MINAS DE ALMADEN TO HOLD MADRID MERCURY CONFERENCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spain's Minas de Almaden y Arrayanes S.A.
Said it will host a conference of mercury producers here at the
end of April to study how to stimulate low mercury prices.
    Last week, Almaden and Algerian producer ENOF agreed to
establish a minimum price of 300 dlrs per flask (34.5 kilos)
for spot mercury sales, up from the previous minimum of 240
dlrs.
    A Minas de Almaden statement said the non-communist world's
main mercury producers had decided not to sign any contracts
using the reference price of specialist publications, because
it was well below their costs of production.
