<TITLE>RUDING AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL, TRADE CURBS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Shifts in domestic economic policy,
not a further fall in the dollar or trade restrictions, are the
key to reducing imbalances in trade and payments, Dutch Finance
Miniister H. Onno Ruding said.
    Ruding told a meeting of the World Trade Forum here that
protectionism would naturally lead to retaliation and aggravate
the problems of heavily indebted developing countries.
    "The main contribution towards resolving the still enourmous
U.S. trade deficit is not repeat not a further fall in the
dollar, is not still more protectionism in your country."
    "No, it is - like in other countries - changes in domestic
economic and financial policies," Ruding said.
    Ruding said he was less worried about a crisis of the
weakening dollar than he was in January before the Paris accord
to stabilize foreign exchange rates.
    He said the highest priority should be given to policy
changes in the United States, especially reducing the budget
deficit and encouraging domestic savings.
    But he said other countries, such as Japan and West
Germany, also needed to take greater steps toward reducing
their trade surpluses.
