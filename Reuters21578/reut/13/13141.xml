<TITLE>NETWORK &lt;NETW&gt; TO TAKE 3RD QTR CHARGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DANBURY, Conn., April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Network Control Corp said it
intends to take a 250,000 dlr charge against earnings for the
third quarter ended March 31 and said sales for the quarter
would be about 400,000 dlrs, about 50 pct below sales in the
same year-ago quarter.
    Network said it is taking the charge due to the significant
increase in accounts receivable which remain uncollected for
more than 90 days after billing. It said it ultimately will
collect most of those accounts.
    It attributed the sales decline to a transition period for
its new products and a delay in a major order.
