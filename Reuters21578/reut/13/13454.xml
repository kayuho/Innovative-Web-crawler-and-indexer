<TITLE>LONDON SUGAR OPENS SLIGHTLY EASIER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Raw sugar futures continued their
overnight decline in early trading by posting losses from
yesterday's final call of 0.40 to 1.20 dlrs, dealers said.
    Volume at the end of a 10 minute opening call was 85 lots.
    The modest fall was attributed to lack of follow-through to
yesterday's mid-session rise with New York's similar downturn
yesterday seen as an additional unsettling influence, they
said.
    There is no fresh physicals news although India and Syria
are in the market tomorrow for whites, to coincide with the
weekly white sugar tender by the European Community (EC).
    Near Aug was at 155.40 dlrs traded from 155.80 bid.
