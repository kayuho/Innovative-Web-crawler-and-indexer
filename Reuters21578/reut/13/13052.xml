<TITLE>MINAS DE ALMADEN RAISES MERCURY PRICE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spain's Minas de Almaden y Arrayanes S.A.
has agreed with Algerian producer ENOF to establish a minimum
price of 300 dlrs per flask for spot mercury sales, Almaden
spokesman Jesus Gallego said.
    In response to enquiries from Reuters, he said his company
had raised the minimum price for its spot sales from 240 dlrs
per flask following talks with ENOF.
    In a separate press release, the company said that ENOF and
Almaden held talks in Istanbul a week ago with Turkish mercury
producers on ways to improve prices, but Gallego said he was
not in a position to say what action the Turkish companies
would be taking.
