<TITLE>U.S. GOLD FUTURES OPEN FIRMER ON WEAK DOLLAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Comex gold futures opened firmer on the
back of a weak dollar and firm silver values.
    The pacesetting June delivery was up 90 cts at 423.50 dlrs
an ounce, recouping some of yesterday's light losses of 1.50
dlrs. Other contracts gained 1.70 to 2.30 dlrs.
    Floor analysts said the precious metal mirrored the action
in the silver trading ring more than anything else. Speculators
continued to buy silver on hopes it would soon hit seven dlrs
an ounce in the May contract.
    The stock market again acted as a drag on gold even though
it slipped on profit-taking this morning, analysts said.
