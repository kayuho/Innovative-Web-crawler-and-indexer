<TITLE>OLIVETTI TO ANNOUNCE NEW COMPUTER LINE IN JUNE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Milan, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ing. C. Olivetti EC Spa &lt;OLIV.MI&gt; plans to
announce a new line of computer products in June, company
chairman Carlo De Benedetti said at a news conference.
    De Benedetti said the new products would include personal
computers and would compete with the new computers announced
last week by International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM&gt;.
    De Benedetti reiterated that Olivetti's provisional figures
show that 1986 turnover rose 1160 billion lire to 7,300 billion
lire and that net profit will be more than 550 billion lire
compared with 503.7 billion the year before.
    "This year will be a year of consolidation of the results
reached thus far and characterized by an important renewal of
the product line and the turnaround of Triumph Adler," he said.
    Olivetti acquired West German typewriter maker &lt;Triumph
Adler&gt; from Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F&gt; last year . As part of the
deal, VW bought a five pct stake in Olivetti. De Benedetti
added that Olivetti would continue to seek international
alliances.
