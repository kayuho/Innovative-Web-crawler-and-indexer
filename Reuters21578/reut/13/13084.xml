<TITLE>PORTUGUESE GOVERNMENT FALLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LISBON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Portugal's minority centre-right
government was ousted in a parliamentary censure vote backed by
three left-wing opposition parties.
    The Socialist Party (PS), Democratic Renewal Party (PRD)
and Communist Party (PCP), who held 140 of the 250 parliament
seats, voted for the motion against the Social Democratic Party
(PSD) government and their Christian Democrat allies.
    President Mario Soares, who returns from a visit to Brazil
on Sunday, was now faced with the task of either forming a new
government or calling an early general election.
