<TITLE>INVESTOR LIFTS MYERS &lt;MYR&gt; STAKE TO 12.1 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Leonard Chavin, a Chicago real estate
developer who has said he is considering seeking control of
L.E. Myers Co Group, said he raised his stake in the company to
273,100 shares, or 12.1 pct, from 219,600, or 9.7 pct.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Chavin said he bought 53,500 Myers common shares between March
10 and 31 at prices ranging from 5-1/2 to six dlrs a share.
    Last January, Chavin said he retained investment banker
R.G. Dickinson and Co to advise him on his Myers stock
dealings. He has also said he would be unable to seek control
of Myers unless he gets financing.
