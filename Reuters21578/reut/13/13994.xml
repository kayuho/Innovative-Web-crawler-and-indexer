<TITLE>FED EXPECTED TO SET CUSTOMER REPURCHASES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve is expected to

temporary reserves indirectly via customer repurchase
agreements, economists said.
    They said the Fed is expected to execute anywhere from
1.5-2.0 billion dlrs of customer repos to offset seasonal
pressures on bank reserves.
