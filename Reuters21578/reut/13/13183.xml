<TITLE>CANADIAN BONDS CLOSE SLIGHTLY LOWER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canadian bonds closed slightly lower on
market jitters amplified by rumors that a big holder of
domestic bonds was selling early in the day, dealers said.
    The market had opened 1/4 to 3/8 point stronger on news of
unexpectedly weak U.S. employment data for March, but the
advance sparked profit-taking which forced prices down about
1/4 point on the day. Rumors of a major seller were not
confirmed but some traders felt limited potential for further
Canadian dollar gains might be taking some of the shine off
domestic bonds. The benchmark Canada 9-1/2 pct of 2001 ended at
106-1/4 3/8 and the 8-1/2 pct of 2011 at 97-1/4 1/2.
