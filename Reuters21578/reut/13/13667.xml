<TITLE>DOLLAR FIXED SLIGHTLY FIRMER IN PARIS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar was fixed slightly above its
opening levels in moderately active trading, dealers said.
    The dollar was fixed at 6.0620 francs after an early
6.0565/90 and a late 6.0710/30 range yesterday, with dealers
unable to pinpoint any specific reason for the slight rise.
    However, the dollar was expected to remain in a narrow
trading range ahead of the Washington monetary talks.

332.72/75 against last night's late 332.70/72 range.
