<TITLE>AGREEMENT REACHED IN GREEK ALUMINA DEAL WITH MOSCOW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATHENS, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Greece and the Soviet Union have reached
agreement in Moscow on a joint venture for a 450 mln dlr
alumina plant in Greece, government spokesman Yannis Roubatis
said.
    Roubatis told reporters the Soviet Union agreed to buy the
plant's entire annual output of 600,000 tonnes of alumina. More
details would be given later by Greek Industry Undersecretary
George Petsos, who was in Moscow.
    The project was due to start in 1986, but problems over
plans to sell some alumina to Bulgaria caused delays. The
Soviet Union, which was to take 400,000 tonnes, later agreed to
take the full production.
