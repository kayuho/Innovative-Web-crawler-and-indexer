ACCU-WEATHER HIGHLIGHTS - APRIL 7
    The storm that battered the eastern portion of the United
States over the weekend with heavy snow and flooding rains will
continue weakening today. Only lighter rains will linger from
Pennsylvania through New England.
    The drier weather will be welcome, as many streams and
rivers are near or over their banks, especially in New England.
    Significant rain has occurred the past two days in the
coffee growing regions of Kenya.
    Prior to Sunday, very dry weather had been occurring in the
central and eastern portions of the coffee areas. However, 0.50
to 2.00 inches and more rain occurred Sunday through Monday,
helping to erase the moisture deficits that had built up.
    The western coffee regions also shared in the ample rains
of the past couple of days, but moisture supplies were already
adequate.
    Moisture supplies in most of the major wheat growing
regions of the United States are currently adequate, despite
dry weather the past week. However, there are a couple of
pockets where rain would be welcome.
    The wheat regions of Washington State have been rather dry
since the beginning of the year, as less than 65 pct of normal
precipitation has been recorded. Also, the past few weeks have
been extremely dry.
    The wheat areas of Minnesota and eastern North Dakota could
also use rain the next few weeks, before spring planting begins.
