<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cargill U.K. Ltd's oilseed processing
plant in Seaforth, northwest England, will resume operations
tomorrow morning following settlement of a labour dispute which
has paralysed production there since December 19, a company
spokesman said.
    It is likely to resume deliveries of soymeal and oil within
a couple of days. Force majeure had previously been declared
for supplies up to, and including May, but the company will
attempt to fulfill all outstanding contracts, the spokesman
said.
