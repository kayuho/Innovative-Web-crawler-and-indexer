<TITLE>OKI ELECTRIC STUDIES IMPORT OF U.S. CAR PHONES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd&gt; may import
car telephones made by its 100 pct U.S. Subsidiary, &lt;Oki
America Inc&gt;, for sale in Japan, an Oki spokesman said.
    The firm would like to import the car phones, which are
made according to a system developed jointly by Motorola Inc
&lt;MOT&gt; of the U.S. And Oki Electric, the spokesman said.
    A final decision will hinge on obtaining approval from
Japan's Post and Telecommunications Ministry and whether or not
it is feasible to convert the models to meet Japanese
specifications, he said.
