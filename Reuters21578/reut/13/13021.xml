<TITLE>UNION TO PROTEST DART'S SUPERMARKETS &lt;SGL&gt; BID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LANDOVER, MD., April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United Food And Commercial
Workers said that more than 1,000 rank-and-file members of the
union will demonstrate Monday at Dart Group Corp's headquarters
protesting Dart's proposed 1.73 billion dlr takover of
Supermarkets General &lt;SGL&gt;.
    Supermarkets is best known for its Pathmark chain of
supermarket drug stores in the New York and New Jersey area and
also owns Rickels home centers.
    The union said that it is firmly against the Dart bid
because "workers have always ended up with a raw deal in the
current takeover mania."
    A Union statement said: "We do not intend to allow our
members to pick up the tab for Supermarket General's executives
and the bankers or the Dart Group who stand to make millions."
    Dart is controlled by the Haft family of Washington, which
last year made a bid for California-based Safeway Stores Inc.
The Hafts lost, but walked away with at least 100 mln dlrs in
profits, analysts estimate.
    The union said that Dart's Safeway bid forced a major
restructuring at Safeway to pay the Hafts and their lawyers and
caused a loss of thousands of jobs.
