<TITLE>BRITISH OPNION POLLS KEEP CONSERVATIVES AHEAD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Two British opinion polls showed the
ruling Conservative Party would retain power with a clear
majority in general elections.
    A poll for commercial television, conducted after Prime
Minister Thatcher returned from Moscow, this morning gave the
Conservatives their highest rating since they were re-elected
in 1983, with 43 pct of the votes, Labour 30 and the Social
Democratic-Liberal Alliance 26 pct.
    Another poll in the Times newspaper taken in 73 key
marginal constituencies, predicted a Conservative majority of
92 seats.
    Thatcher, does not have to call elections until June 1988.
