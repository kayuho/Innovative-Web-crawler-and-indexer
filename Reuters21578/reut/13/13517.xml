<TITLE>MALAYSIAN CRUDE PALM OIL CLOSES BELOW HIGHS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Crude palm oil prices closed below
the day's highs on late selling, prompted by talk that Pakistan
passed on its tender for 6,000 tonnes of RBD palm oil for
second half April shipment after having bought the same amount
yesterday, dealers said.
    Pakistan's presence and steadier overnight Chicago soyoil
futures supported the market initially, they added.
    April deliveries, south and central regions closed five
higher at 752.50 and 750 ringgit per tonne respectively after
highs of 757.50 while May south traded down to 750 from 755.
    The refined palm oil market saw some renewed interest, with
prices also higher initially. May and June RBD palm olein
traded earlier at 332.50 dlrs per tonne, and May RBD palm oil
at 318.
