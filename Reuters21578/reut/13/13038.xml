<TITLE>CITIZENS FIRST BANCORP &lt;CFB&gt; RECEIVES FINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GLEN ROCK, N.J., April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Citizens First Bancorp Inc said
its banking subsidiary pleaded guilty to two technical
violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and was fined 2,000 dlrs.
    The subsidiary, Citizens First National Bank of New Jersey,
pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors in Federal District Court
for the District of New Jersey. Charges had been brought by the
U.S. Attorney's office.
    The company said no additional charges will be brought
against it and that it has instituted additional procedures to
reduce the possibility of future violations. It cooperated with
authorities in the investigation.
    The violations occurred on Aug 12, 1982, and May 25, 1984,
when the bank failed to report currency transactions involving
more than 10,000 dlrs.
