<TITLE>JAPAN'S LIPC TO BUY BEEF ON APRIL 23</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's Livestock Industry Promotion Corp
(LIPC) said that on April 28 it will import 7,515 tonnes of
beef for the first half of the 1987 fiscal year started on
April 1 under the simultaneous buy and sell tender system,
against 6,813 a year ago.
    The system calls on the agency to buy beef from trading
houses and simultaneously sell it to users in one tender. The
tender quota in April-September is 10 pct of the agency's beef
import share. Japan's beef import quota in 1987/88 was set at
93,000 tonnes against 85,000 for the same period in 1986/87.
