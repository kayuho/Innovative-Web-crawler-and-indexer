<TITLE>SCOTT INSTRUMENTS &lt;SCTI&gt; GETS QUALIFIED AUDIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DENTON, Texas, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Scott Instruments Corp said its
independent public accountants qualified the report on Scott's
1986 financial statements because of its weak financial
condition.
    The report indicates the realization of the company's
assets is dependent on it obtaining enough working capital to
finance operations and additional funds to meet other
liabilities, among other things.
    These factors indicate the company may be unable to
continue its existence.
    Earlier, Scott reported a 1986 loss of 1.9 mln dlrs
compared to a loss of almost 2.2 mln dlrs in 1985. Total assets
were nearly 1.1 mln dlrs at year end, down from 1.2 mln dlrs
the prior year.
