<TITLE>SOUTH KOREA'S 1987 GNP SEEN GROWING NINE PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea's gross national product (gnp)
is forecast to grow by nine pct in 1987, surpassing the
government's original forecast of eight pct and against a 12.5
pct rise in 1986, an Economic Planning Board report said.
    The report reviewing the country's economy in the first
three months of this year said year-on-year gnp was
provisionally estimated to have grown by about 12 pct in the
period, against a 10.5 pct growth in the same 1986 period.
    Board officials said the gnp rise in the January-March
period is due largely to increased exports, which totalled 9.34
billion dlrs against 6.9 billion a year earlier.
