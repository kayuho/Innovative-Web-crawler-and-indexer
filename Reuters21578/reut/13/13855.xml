<TITLE>CBT SOYPRODUCT FUTURES EXPECTED STEADY/EASIER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>CBT soyproduct futures were called
steady to slightly easier in sympathy with expected weakness in
soybeans, traders said.
    Soybean crush ratios remained under pressure yesterday, so
further decline in the U.S. soybean crush rate is needed before
soyproducts can begin to show strength relative to soybeans,
they added.
