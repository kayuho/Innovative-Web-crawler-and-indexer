<TITLE>BRAZIL TO BUY 30,000 BPD OF KUWAITI OIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil will import 30,000 barrels
per day of crude oil from Kuwait, a spokesman for the state oil
company Petrobras said.
    He said that, unlike Saudi Arabia, Kuwait did not impose
any conditions on Brazil.
    Last month, Petrobras cancelled a 40-mln dlr oil purchase
from Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit
guarantees from the official Bank of Brazil.
    The Saudis eventually lifted the condition and Brazil
decided to reconfirm the purchase.
    Brazil currently consumes 1.1 mln barrels of oil per day.
