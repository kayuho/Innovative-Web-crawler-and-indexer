<TITLE>CBT SOYBEAN FUTURES EXPECTED STEADY TO EASIER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>CBT soybean futures were expected to
open steady, possibly easier on a disappointing weekly soybean
export figure below the previous week and year ago levels and
moderate country movement overnight, traders said.
    The outlook for increased Brazilian harvest pressure later
this month and the settlement of the Brazilian seamen strike
will add to the negative sentiment in old crop.
 ----
 Brazil's soybean harvest was 24 pct complete by April 3,
compared with an average of 36 pct, the Safras and Mercado
newsletter said, with Rio Grande do Sul 10 pct and 17 pct
respectively, Parana 55 and 63 pct respectively, Mato Grosso do
Sul 30 and 36 pct, Mato Grosso 10 pct and NA, Goias 10 pct and
NA and other states 25/30 and 36 pct respectively.
