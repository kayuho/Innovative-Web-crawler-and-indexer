signed a memorandum of understanding to boost two-way trade and
joint industrial ventures in both countries, spokesmen of the

Australia would improve in the next few months and reduce the
trade balance which is heavily in Australia's favour.

goods, including steel and coking coal, to India and bought
170.5 mln worth of items, including cotton textiles, from India.
