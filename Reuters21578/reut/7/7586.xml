<TITLE>SWISS FINANCE MINISTRY CALLS TWO SEASONED BONDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BERNE, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Swiss Finance Ministry said it was
calling two bond issues of a total 550 mln Swiss francs as part
of its effort to retire outstanding high-interest debt.
    The calls, to be made effective June 30 and September 30,
affected respectively the 7-1/4 pct bond of 1975 for 250 mln
francs and the 6-1/2 pct bond of the same year for 300 mln.
    A spokesman said the ministry had not yet decided whether
to convert the issues into new bonds, but it had outlined plans
for two new bonds, each of 250 mln francs. The strong state of
government finances might permit it not to issue one or both of
them, he said.
