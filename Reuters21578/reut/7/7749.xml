<TITLE>DIXONS SAYS SEC MOVING ON CYCLOPS &lt;CYL&gt; TENDER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Dixons Group PLC&gt; said the 
Securities and Exchange Commission has authorized, but not
commenced, the filing of an action against it concerning its
waiver of a condition in its tender offer for Cyclops Corp.
    Dixons has offered to buy about 80 pct of Cyclops shares.
The SEC action deals with a waiver by Dixons of a condition in
the tender offer which was made without an appropriate
extension of the offer, Dixons said.
    Dixons also said it is currently discussing the matter with
the SEC. The SEC has a standing policy of never confirming
or denying investigations or upcoming legal action.
