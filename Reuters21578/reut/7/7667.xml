<TITLE>LISBON OFFICIAL SAYS "NO PROBLEMS" ON MACAO</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Portuguese official today said no more
problems remained in settling the future of Macao, and China's
Foreign Ministry said an "important announcement" would be made
at the end of talks on the tiny territory.
    A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, indicating the two
countries were close to agreement on the handover of Macao to
Peking, told journalists: "The talks are still in progress. When
they end, there will be an important announcement."
    Portuguese Ambassador to China Octavio Valerio said there
would be no formal talks over the weekend, but chief Portuguese
negotiator Rui Medina said earlier he would have contacts later
today with his Chinese counterpart Zhou Nan. Valerio said the
next formal talks would be Monday. "It will be the last one and
we hope there will be a communique."
