<TITLE>TRANSAMERICA &lt;TA&gt; TO HAVE GAIN ON UNIT SALE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, MArch 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Transamerica Corp said it expects
to realize a gain of about 75 mln dlrs on the
previously-announced sale of the group life and health
operations of its Transamerican Occidental Life Insurance Co
subsidiary to Provident Life and Accident Co &lt;PACC&gt;.
    But it said its Transamerica Life Cos unit plans to change
to a more conservative method of amortizing deferred policy
acquisition costs, resulting in a one-time charge that will
offset most of the gain from the sale.
    Transamerica said it has now signed a definitive agreement
for the sale, which will be structured as a reinsurance
transaction involving about 400 mln dlrs of reserve
liabilities.
    It said the 75 mln dlr gain from the sale and about 125 mln
dlrs of statutory surplus that previously supported operations
of the group being sold will be used to support Transamerica
Life Cos' efforts to accelerate the growth of its remaining
businesses.  It said closing is expected by May One, subject to
regulatory approvals.
