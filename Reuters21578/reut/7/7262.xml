<DATELINE>    COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>IntelliCARD
International Inc said its common stock will continue to be
quoted on NASDAQ due to an exception from capital asset
requirements of the National Association of Securities Dealers,
which it failed to meet as of December 16.
    The company said it believes it can meet conditions imposed
by the NASD for the exception, but there is no assurance that
it will be able to do so.
