<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Guilford Mills Inc is raising 75 mln
dlrs via an offering of convertible subordinated debentures due

Bear, Stearns and Co.
    The debentures are convertible into the company's common
stock at 44.25 dlrs per share, representing a premium of 25.08
pct over the stock price when terms on the debt were set.

Moody's and BBB-minus by Standard and Poor's. The issue was
increased from an initial offering of 60 mln dlrs because of
investor demand.
