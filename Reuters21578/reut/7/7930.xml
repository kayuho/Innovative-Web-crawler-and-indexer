<TITLE>DELTA SAYS COURT ORDER WILL NOT DELAY MERGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATLANTA, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Delta Air Lines &lt;DAL&gt; said a court
order requiring Western Air Lines &lt;WAL&gt; to arbitrate with two
of its unions will not delay the April 1 merger between the two
airlines.
    The order, which was issued by the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals, requires Western to discuss with its two unions
whether Western's labor contracts will be binding for Delta,
Delta said.
    "Nevertheless, the court order could cause significant
personnel problems, including the possible delay of wage
increases Delta had planned to give the Western personnel on
April 1," Ronald Allen, Delta's president, said.
    Delta said it feels the court has erred and should
reconsider the order.
