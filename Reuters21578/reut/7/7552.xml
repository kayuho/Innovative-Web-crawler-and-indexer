<TITLE>PHILIPPINE COPPER SMELTER FACES SHIPMENT DELAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Copper shipments are likely to be
delayed because of power problems at &lt;Philippine Associated
Smelting and Refining Corp&gt; (PASAR), the country's only
smelter, a company official said.
    Asked to confirm reports by New York copper trade sources
about PASAR's shipment problems, marketing manager Deogracias
Madrid told Reuters, "They are partly correct. There could be a
probable delay."
    Madrid declined to give more details, or production and
export figures, saying the information could lead to
speculation.
    PASAR's smelter is in the central province of Leyte.
    The New York trade sources said if PASAR's shipments were
delayed, customers might have to turn to the London Metal
Exchange for supply.
    "We have a commitment to our customers and I would not like
to comment on that," Madrid said.
    A spokeswoman for the Chamber of Mines said Philippine
copper production amounted to 222,644 tonnes in 1986, down
slightly from 226,157 tonnes in 1985. She said production in
the first two months of 1987 totalled 34,550 tonnes, compared
with 36,462 tonnes in the same 1986 period.
