<TITLE>BENETTON OF ITALY SEES EXPANSION, ACQUISITIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Benetton SpA&gt; of Italy expects to
further diversify into financial services and is weighing 
possible acquisitions, a Benetton spokeswoman here said.
    "We are thinking of diversification outside of the retail
line," the spokeswoman said. "We are looking at financial
services and other manfacturing companies."
    However, she said the company was not targeting the U.S.
for its planned expansion, but was looking at a number of
different countries.
    The company's shares are traded in the U.S. as American
Depository Receipts, which were issued through an offering by
Morgan Stanley Group Inc &lt;MS&gt; earlier this month.
    Benetton is now holding talks with Wall Street firms about
the possibility of receiving a quotation of its shares on the
New York Stock Exchange. "There's absolutely no timetable. It
may not even happen," the spokeswoman said.
    She also denied reports that the company was considering an
issue of convertible bonds with warrants in the U.S. "We're not
thinking of issuing bonds," she said.
    In line with its planned Global expansion efforts, Benetton
is also holding talks with the Soviet Union to explore the
possibility of opening up to 150 stores in the country. But the
spokeswoman pointed out that many companies are holding talks
with the Soviets.
    "We are in discussions and are looking forward to some
response," she said. She added the company had no firm
timetable on when a response might be received.
