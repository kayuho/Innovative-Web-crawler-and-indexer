<TITLE>AMERICAN MOTORS &lt;AMO&gt; BOARD MEETING ON TAKEOVER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Motors Corp's board of
directors is meeting this morning in New York to consider
Chrysler Corp's &lt;C&gt; 1.5 billion dlr takeover offer, an American
Motors spokesman said.
    The spokesman reiterated statements made earlier in the
week that the regularly scheduled meeting was being held.
    The spokesman would not comment on recurring speculation
that the board might receive a higher offer from Chrysler.
Analysts have said the fact that American Motors' stock has
remained above the four dlrs a share Chrysler offer could lead
the larger company to raise its bid.
    The American Motors spokesman said he had not seen any
indication that a higher offer would be received from Chrysler,
although he added, "I don't know what the conversation is in
the meeting."
    He repeated statements made earlier in the week by the
automaker that today's meeting will probably not result in a
final decision on the Chrysler bid.
    "The board first apprised the proposal on the 11th (of
March). I suspect there will be several more (meetings) after
this," the spokesman said.
    The meeting is expected to go through early afternoon.
