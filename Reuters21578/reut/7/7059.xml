<TITLE>COCA-COLA &lt;KO&gt; IN FILM COLORING VENTURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MARINA DEL RAY, Calif., March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Color Systems Technology
Inc &lt;CLST&gt; said it has completed formation of a joint venture
called Screen Gems Classicolor with Coca-Cola Co to color and
distribute feature films and television programs.
    Color Systems said it and Coca-Cola will share profits from
worldwide television, basic cable, pay television and home
video distribution, and Color Systems will also be paid by the
venture to convert to color the black and white material
involved.
    The company said Coca-Cola has initially contributed a
number of its Screen Gems television series and Color Systems
its library of more than 100 feature films and television
series. It said the venture expects to acquire more black and
white material for color conversion and will start generating
revenues by distributing the combined library initially as-is.
