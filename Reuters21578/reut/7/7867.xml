<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>ChemLawn Corp said it had no comment
on a sweetened offer from Waste Management Inc &lt;WMX&gt;.
    Waste Management amended its 27 dlr per share tender offer,
raising it to 35 dlrs per share.
    ChemLawn had rejected Waste Management's earlier 27 dlr per
share offer, saying it was an undervalued bid. ChemLawn earlier
told its shareholders not to tender to Waste Management.
    ChemLawn rose 1-7/8 to 36 in over-the-counter trading.
