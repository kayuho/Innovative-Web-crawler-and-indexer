<TITLE>CARTERET SAVINGS&lt;CBC&gt; COMPLETES SALE OF BRANCHES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MORRISTOWN, N.J., March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Carteret Savings Bank said it
has completed the previously announced sale of six Virginia
branches to Charter Federal Savings and Loan Association
&lt;CHFD&gt;.
    Carteret said it has opened a retail banking office in
Vienna, Va., as the next step in its move to build a strong
presence in the Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Md., area.
    Carteret said the new bank has two offices outside
Baltimore, which were acquired last June when Carteret merged
with Admiral Builders Savings and Loan Association.
    The company said it plans to open a retail banking office
in downtown Washington this summer, plus several more offices
in Baltimore County and others in Fairfax County, Va. Carteret
said it may open more loan offices in Virginia and Maryland.
