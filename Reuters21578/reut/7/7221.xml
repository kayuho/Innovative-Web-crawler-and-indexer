<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>French official reserves rose 12.73
billion francs to 388.68 billion francs at the end of February
from 375.95 billion at the end of January, the Finance Ministry
said.

which resulted in an increase of 12.41 billion francs.
    Reserves of European Currency Units rose by 25 mln francs
