<TITLE>LAWSON REPEATS HE IS CONTENT WITH STERLING LEVEL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
today repeated that he was satisfied with the current level of
sterling, both against the dollar and the West German mark.
    Lawson said in a television interview that he did not
regard the pound's present exchange rate was uncomfortably
high.
    "I think it is round about right," he said.
    "I think there was a time that they (British manufacturers)
thought the (exchange) rate was uncomfortably high. But I think
they are very satisfied with the present level."
    "But I have made it absolutely clear that I don't want to
see the pound go through the roof," he added.
