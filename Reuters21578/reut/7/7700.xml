<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Grain analysts surveyed by the American
Soybean Association, ASA, projected acreage this year at 59.1
mln acres of soybeans and 64.7 mln acres of corn.
    In 1986, farmers planted 61.5 mln acres of soybeans and
76.7 mln acres of corn, according to the February 9 USDA
supply/demand report. The USDA is to release its 1987 planting
intentions report March 31.

soybeans and 59.5 mln to 68.0 mln acres of corn.
