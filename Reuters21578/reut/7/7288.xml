<TITLE>CDC MAY SELL FALCONBRIDGE (FALCF) DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     TORONTO, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Canada Development Corp&gt; said it is
considering the sale of the 270.8 mln dlrs it holds of
Falconbridge Ltd's 8.5 pct convertible debentures and of its 25
pct holding in &lt;CDC Life Sciences Inc&gt;.
    It said it made the disclosure in two prospectuses filed
today with the Ontario Securities Commission.
    CDC said one prospectus covers a planned issue of units to
raise up to 30 mln dlrs for subsidiary Canterra Energy Ltd's
1987 exploration spending. A second prospectus relates to a
planned public sale of four mln common shares which CDC sold
privately to an unidentified investor in December.
    CDC said the unit offering will consist of a maximum of
18,750 units priced at 1,600 dlrs each. Each unit will comprise
an interest in CDC Flow-Through limited partnership and common
shares of Canterra which will be exchanged for CDC common
shares.
    Through a series of transactions, investors will receive
100 common shares of CDC for each unit, representing a price of
16 dlrs a common share. They will also get rights to income tax
deductions equal to the price of each unit.
    Agents for the sale are Wood Gundy Inc and Dominion
Securities Inc.
