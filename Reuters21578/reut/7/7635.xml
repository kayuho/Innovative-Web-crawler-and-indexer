<DATELINE>    PLYMOUTH, Minn., March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>C.O.M.B. Co said its board has
approved a proposal to acquire the 50 pct of Cable Value

company now has about 18.1 mln shares outstanding.
    C.O.M.B. said the transaction is subject to the parties
entering into an agreement which would be subject to approval
by its shareholders and regulatory agencies.
