<TITLE>PHILIPS IN MARKETING PACT WITH U.S. FIRM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    EINDHOVEN, Netherlands, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>NV Philips
Gloeilampenfabrieken &lt;PGLO.AS.&gt; said it planned to pool
world-wide sales and marketing of electronic test and measuring
equipment with U.S. Firm &lt;John Fluke Mfg Co Inc&gt;.
    It said from this autumn Fluke will sell, service and
distribute Philips test and measuring products in North America
and selected markets including China, Hong Kong and Japan.
Philips will cover mainly European markets for Fluke.
    The Dutch company said it will buy a minority equity stake
in Fluke and name a board member. Its equity holding will not
exceed 10 pct, Philips said.
    The companies will also explore possible new joint ventures
to develop new product lines, Philips said.
    It estimated the world-wide market for test and measuring
equipment at six billion dlrs in 1986.
    Fluke had 1986 sales of 209 mln dlrs last year and Philips'
turnover on test and measuring gear was of comparable size.
    A Philips spokesman said the world leaders in the field
were Hewlett-Packard Co &lt;HWP.AS&gt; and Tekronix Inc &lt;TEK.N&gt;, with
the combined operations of Philips and Fluke third.
