<TITLE>RJR NABISCO &lt;RJR&gt; NOMINATES NEW CHAIRMAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>RJR Nabisco Inc said it
nominated J. Paul Sticht to become chairman of the board,
replacing J. Tylee Wilson, who will take early retirement.
    Sticht retired as chairman and chief executive officer of
R.J. Reynolds Industries Inc in 1983.
    Sticht's appointment will be voted on by RJR's board at its
regular meeting on April 22, the company said.
    The company also said F. Ross Johnson, 55, president and
chief executive officer, will assume the additional post of
chairman of the executive committee, succeeding Sticht, who is
69.
    Wilson, 55, had said previously that he planned to take
early retirement.
    A company spokesman said Sticht will serve as chairman
until April 1988, when he will retire. He said the appointment
of Sticht was recommended by Johnson.
    "These key management actions will significantly strengthen
the company's leadership," Johnson said.
    The company said James O. Welch, head of its Nabisco Brands
unit, was named a vice chairman of the parent company.
    It added that Robert J. Carbonell, an executive vice
president, was promoted to the position of senior executive
vice president of the parent.
