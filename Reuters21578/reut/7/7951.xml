<TITLE>CCC GUARANTEES TO TURKEY SWITCHED TO MEALS-USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Commodity Credit Corporation,
CCC, has reallocated 15.0 mln dlrs in credit guarantees to
Turkey previously earmarked for sales of U.S. oilseeds to
provide coverage for sales of U.S. protein meals in fiscal year
1987, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    The department said the action reduces the guarantee line
authorized for sales of oilseeds to 5.0 mln dlrs from 20.0 mln
dlrs and creates the new line for protein meals.
    All sales under the credit lines must be registered and
exports completed by September 30, 1987, it said.
