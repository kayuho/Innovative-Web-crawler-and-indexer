<TITLE>ECHLIN&lt;ECH&gt; EXPECTS CONTINUED PROFIT GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRANFORD, Conn., March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Echlin Inc said it expects
further earnings increases for the second half of fiscal 1987
ending in August due to unit sales growth and improved
operations.
    "As expected, market conditions have improved so that
demand for automotive replacement parts is gradually and
steadily expanding," Echlin president Frederick Mancheski said.
    Earlier, Echlin reported first half fiscal 1987, ended Feb
28, earnings of 23.2 mln dlrs, or 48 cts a share, up from 16.6

mln dlrs, or 24 cts per share, compared with net income of 8.3
mln dlrs, or 20 cts a share, in fiscal 1986's second quarter.
