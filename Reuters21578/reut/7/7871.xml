<TITLE>COOK &lt;CCF&gt; TO POST LOSS, SELL STAKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CLEVELAND, OHio, march 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cook United INc said it expects
to report a loss a loss of 16 mln dlrs, before an extraordinary
credit of 44 mln dlrs resulting from its Chapter 11
reorganization, on sales of 217 mln dlrs for the year ended
January 31, 1987.
    For 1986, Cook reported a loss of 30.8 mln dlrs on sales of
257 mln dlrs for the prior year.
    Cook also said it began preliminary talks with private
investors looking to buy a stock position in order to provide
Cook with additional cash and assist its posture in its
negotation with its banks.
    Cook is negotiating with its bank lenders and private
sources for a borrowing facility to relieve its current working
capital requirements.
    Cook said it believes the reasons for its losses since
OCtober have been identified and are mostly non-recurring.
    Shutting down 12 unprofitable stores since November has   
effectuated cost controls and improved merchandising, it said.
    It anticipates the turnaround will contine and that
profitability with be restored. Cook now operates a total of 29
stores.
