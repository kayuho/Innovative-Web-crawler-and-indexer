<TITLE>FREIGHT, INSURANCE PROPOSED FOR CCC SALES - USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>the U.S. Agriculture Department is
proposing to permit coverage of freight cost and marine and war
risk insurance for sales  of all agricultural commodities sold
on credit terms under the Commodity Credit Corporation's, CCC,
credit guarantee programs.
    The proposal only applies to commodities that are sold by
exporters on a cost and freight, C and F, or cost, insurance
and freight, CIF, basis, since these costs would be included in
the exporter's sale price to the foreign buyer, it said.
    Under current programs, freight costs can be covered only
for export sales of U.S. breeding animals.
    It asked for comments on the proposal by April 20.
