<TITLE>SWISS BANKS MEET CHURCHES OVER S. AFRICA LOANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Swiss banks are holding talks with
Protestant and Roman Catholic officials to hear church
complaints about lending to South Africa, the Swiss Bankers'
Association said.
    In a statement the Association said the parties had
disagreed over economic sanctions.
    But all participants -- representatives of the three
biggest Swiss banks, the Bankers' Association itself, the
churches and church charities -- agreed to condemn South
Africa's apartheid policy both publicly and in contacts with
business and government offices there.
    After two private sessions last August and on March 10,
they agreed the meetings should continue.
    Swiss banks are criticised by the churches who say they are
in effect lending support to the South African government.
    The banks assured the churchmen that their lending had
declined substantially last year and that they had no intention
of building it up as banks from other countries withdrew.
    Pius Haffner of the Catholic charity Justitia et Pax told
Reuters, "It is at least a small step forward when the banks say
publicly they will not jump in when other banks pull out."
