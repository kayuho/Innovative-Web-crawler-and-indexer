<TITLE>FED EXPECTED TO TAKE NO MONEY MARKET ACTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve is expected to
refrain from reserve-management intervention in the U.S.
Government securities market, economists said.
    If the Fed does act, however, they said it would be likely
to add temporary reserves indirectly by arranging around 1.5
billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements.
    Federal funds, which averaged 5.97 pct yesterday, opened at
six pct and remained there in early trading.
