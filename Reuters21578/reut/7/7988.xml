<TITLE>SUPER VALU &lt;SVU&gt; SETS LOWER CAPITAL SPENDING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Super Valu Stores Inc said its
capital budget for the fiscal year beginning March One is 330
mln dlrs.
    It said it spent 363.7 mln dlrs last year, primarily
because the previous year's budget included funding for such
major projects as completely new distribution centers.
    It said the current budget provides for significant
additions to a number of its new distribution centers, for
upgrades in computer equipment, for 10 new ShopKo stores and 70
mln dlrs in financing for the company's independent retailer
customers.
