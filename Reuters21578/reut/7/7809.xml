<TITLE>NO FORCE MAJEURE ON LEAD FROM CAPPER PASS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Smelter Capper Pass denied rumours
that the company had declared, or was about to declare, force
majeure on lead deliveries.
    This followed trader talk on the London Metal Exchange,
LME, after broker bids were made at increased premiums for
Capper Pass brand material.
    Traders said some slight production problems seem to exist
but are unlikely to have any impact on the market. Lead values
on the LME today were unchanged around 299 stg per tonne for
three months delivery after thin business in a one stg range.
