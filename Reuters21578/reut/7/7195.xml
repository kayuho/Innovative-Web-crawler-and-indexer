<TITLE>PACIFIC TELESIS &lt;PAC&gt; UP ON SMITH BARNEY OPINION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, MARCH 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The stock of Pacific Telesis Group
rose 1/2 to 54-1/8 in active trading after analyst Charles
Schelke of Smith Barney upgraded a recommendation on the stock
to "buy" from "accumulate," traders said.
    Schelke was unavailable for comment.
    Traders familiar with the opinion said the recommendation
noted that a possible operating rate reduction had already been
discounted in the stock yesterday when it fell 1-7/8, making
the stock a good buy today.
