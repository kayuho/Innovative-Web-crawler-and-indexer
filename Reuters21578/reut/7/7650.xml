<TITLE>TWA &lt;TWA&gt; IN COURT SETTLEMENT WITH USAIR &lt;U&gt;</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trans World Airlines Inc said it
reached an agreement yesterday in federal court with USAir
Group Inc that prevents TWA from buying additional shares of
USAir.
    Under the agreement, TWA, which holds about 15 pct of USAir
stock, will not buy more USAir shares before April 23 and will
not do so after that date without giving 14 days notice to
USAir.
    TWA also agreed that it would not knowingly and willingly
interfere with the consummation of the merger between USAir and
Piedmont Aviation Inc &lt;PIE&gt;.
    TWA said the court agreement confirms previous
announcements by the company, in filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, that it does not presently intend to
seek control of USAir or to acquire additional common stock.
    As a result of the agreement, the court removed a previous
temporary restraining order against TWA, the company said.
    TWA and USAir have also agreed that all litigation between
them in Pittsburgh and Delaware will be stayed until April 23.
TWA said the agreement does not prevent it from commenting to
regulatory agencies on the USAir, Piedmont merger.
    In a separate statement, USAir said the agreement also
included a provision that all USAir shares currently owned by
TWA and its chairman, Carl Icahn, will be voted through a
voting trust in proportion to the votes of other shares not
controlled by TWA or Icahn.
