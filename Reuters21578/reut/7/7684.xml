<TITLE>GULF CANADA &lt;GOC&gt; ASSERTS NO DAMAGE FROM SPILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Calgary, Alberta, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gulf Canada Corp said a
discharge of material at its Amauligak drilling site in the
Beaufort Sea caused no danger to the environment.
    Yesterday, the federal department of energy charged Gulf
Canada with eight counts of illegal dumping for discharging
powdered cement and drilling mud between September 23 and 30
last year.
    The charges carry a maximum 50,000 dlr fine on each count.
    Gulf said the government's charges relate to discharging
materials without a permit, not to environmental damage
resulting from the action.
    Gulf said it voluntarily informed appropriate government
officials when the material was discharged.
    The company also said none of the material was discharged
within 12 miles of the closest shoreline. It added that one of
the materials cited, barite, is a naturally occurring mineral
routinely discharged into the sea during drilling operations.
