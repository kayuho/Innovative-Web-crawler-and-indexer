<TITLE>MINISTER PREDICTS ONE PCT INFLATION FOR SINGAPORE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>Singapore will have an inflation rate
of one pct in 1987, up from a negative 1.4 pct in 1986, Trade
and Industry Minister Lee Hsien Loong told Parliament.
    He said the 1986 drop in the inflation rate, the first fall
in a decade, was due largely to lower world prices for oil and
oil-related items.
    But Lee said the negative inflation rate is unlikely to be
repeated this year because of projected higher prices for
primary commodities and oil.
