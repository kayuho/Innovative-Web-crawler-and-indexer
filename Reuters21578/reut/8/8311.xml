<TITLE>TONKA &lt;TKA&gt; SEES LOWER FISCAL FIRST QUARTER NET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MINNETONKA, MINN., March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>Tonka Corp said it expects
results for its fiscal first quarter to end April four, to
decline from the record earnings of 3.8 mln dlrs or 57 cts a
share and revenues of 53.2 mln dlrs.
    The toy manufacturer attributed its anticipated lower
financial results to an an expected moderate decline in
shipments of its Pound Puppies product line.
    Tonka also said it expects revenues and earnings to remain
lower through the 1987 first half compared with 1986 record
results of 125.4 mln dlrs in revenues and 10.3 mln dlrs in net
earnings or 1.47 dlrs a share.
    The company said its level of shipments is good despite a
conservative buying pattern on the part of retailers industry
wide. Tonka's first quarter shipments will be down somewhat
from 1986 record levels and gross profit margins will be down
slightly from a year ago, it said.
    Second half sales are expected to be stronger based on a
return to a more traditional seasonal shipping pattern in which
retailers order and stock conservatively early in the year and
time large shipments for the second half, it said.
    Tonka said that while the pace of order writing is trailing
last year's, bookings are "very good" for orders on several of
its new product introductions for 1987.
