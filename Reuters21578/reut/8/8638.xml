<TITLE>DROUGHT HITS THAI RUBBER AND FRUIT GROWERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>A drought that began seven weeks ago is
hurting orchards and rubber plantations in Thailand and
officials said it could last until May.
    The government is trucking water into parched farms in
parts of northeastern, eastern and southern provinces, but not
enough to satisfy farmers, according to press reports.
    There has been no official estimate of damage.
    Officials of Thailand's rain-making institute said its
airplanes could help little because few clouds were forming for
them to seed with rain-making chemicals. Thailand has a rainy
season that normally starts in May and lasts to October.
