<TITLE>FED'S HELLER URGES JAPANESE TO BUY U.S. GOODS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>A member of the Federal Reserve
Board, Robert Heller, said he wanted to see stronger Japanese
demand for American goods.
    "What I was advocating here was more Japanese purchases of
American goods," Heller said in response to a question about the
dollar's weakness in currency markets.
    He told a Heritage Foundation forum, "I'd be very happy to
see that."
    In his formal remarks, Heller said he supported the idea of
using commodity prices as an indicator for monetary policy.
    Asked if he would raise the issue at the next Federal Open
Market Committee meeting, he said, "Even at previous meetings
commodity prices were raised."
    He added, "I would not expect future meetings to be
different from past meetings in that respect."
