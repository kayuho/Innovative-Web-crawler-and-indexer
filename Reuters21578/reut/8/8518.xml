<TITLE>HARCOURT &lt;HBJ&gt; DISAPPOINTED WITH HARPER &lt;HPR&gt;</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc said it
is disappointed that no negotiations with Harper and Row
Publishers Inc are underway.
    Harcourt made a 50 dlrs a share unsolicited bid on March
11.
    On March 17, Harcourt said three of its officers met with
Harper's financial advisor but has had no discussions since
then.
    Harcourt said it does not plan to increase its bid.
    Harcourt's bid was preceded by an earlier 34 dlrs a share
bid by Theodore Cross.
    Harper had no response to Harcourt's announcement. Earlier
today, Harper said a recently appointed special committee of
independent directors had received expressions of interest from
several domestic and foreign firms with respect to
restructuring or acquisition transactions.
    Harper said no determination had been made as to any
transaction and that its special committee is continuing in
talks with interested parties in an effort to come to a
conclusion in the near future.
