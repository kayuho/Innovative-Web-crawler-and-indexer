<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>A further special session of the
International Tin Council, ITC, held here tomorrow, March 24,
will give member countries an update on the latest debate over
the hundreds of millions of sterling lost when its buffer stock
price support scheme failed in October 1985, delegates said.
    But the ITC quarterly session scheduled for April 8-9 will
be important, as the council will by then be wanting to decide
on whether the current pact should be extended beyond June 30
or just allowed to expire, delegates said. A two year extension
is possible.
