<TITLE>HEWLETT-PACKARD &lt;HWP&gt; BEGINS TEST SHIPMENTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hewlett-Packard Co said it began
limited customer shipments of its HP 3000 Series 930 business
computer and remains on schedule for first commercial shipments
in mid-1987.
    Shipments of the higher-performance series 950 business
computers are scheduled for the second half of this year, it
said.
    In September, the company postponed initial shipments of
the Series 930 computer until mid-1987 because performance of
the operating software system was below target.
