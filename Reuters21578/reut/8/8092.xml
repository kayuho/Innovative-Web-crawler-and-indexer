<TITLE>WORKERS AT SPANISH GM UNIT CALL STRIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 22 - </DATELINE><BODY>Workers at &lt;General Motors Espanola
S.A.&gt; have called for five days of strikes next month in a
dispute over this year's wage increase, union sources said.
    They said the unofficial strike calendar had been set for
April 2, 7, 8, 21 and 22.
    The workers are seeking a wage rise above this year's five
pct inflation target set by the government. The government and
employers' organisations have urged companies to hold wage
rises below this level.
    Average wages rose 8.2 pct last year compared with an 8.3
pct increase in the cost of living.
    General Motors Espanalo was the top sales performer last
year among Spain's six car manufacturers.
    The Saragossa-based plant reported a 53.1 pct rise in
domestic sales to 538,654 units.
    Ford Espana S.A. Was second with a 27.8 pct gain over 1985.
    General Motors Espanola is 100 pct owned by General Motors
Corp &lt;GM.N&gt; and Ford Espana is wholly-owned by Ford Motor Co
&lt;F.N&gt;.
