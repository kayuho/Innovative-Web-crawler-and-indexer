<DATELINE>    CHARLOTTE, N.C, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Celanese Industrial Fibers, a
division of &lt;Hoechst Celanese Corp's&gt; Celanese Fibers Inc
subsidiary, said it is producing industrial miltifilament yarns
of polyetheretherketone polymer for the first time in the
United States.
    Hoechst and Celanese completed their merger last month.

operated separately from Hoechst Celanese Corp until the parent
company decides on one of two divestment options.
