<TITLE>NORTHEAST, EASTERN THAILAND FACE SEVERE DROUGHT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thirteen provinces, mainly in northeast
and eastern Thailand, have been suffering a worse than average
drought since mid-February and the dry spell is expected to
last until early May, Deputy Interior Minister Santi
Chaiviratana said.
    Santi told reporters the government is launching a drought
relief operation mainly involving the use of water trucks to
send water to affected farming areas.
    He did not say what crops have been damaged in northeast
Thailand but said large durian orchards in eastern Chanthaburi
province have suffered heavy losses.
    The Minister said the affected areas include eight
provinces in the northeast, two in eastern Thailand and three
rubber growing provinces in the south near the Malaysian
border.
