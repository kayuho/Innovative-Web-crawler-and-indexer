<TITLE>SWEDISH GNP ROSE LESS THAN EXPECTED, FIGURES SHOW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sweden's Gross National Product rose
1.3 pct last year against 2.3 pct in 1985, mainly due to a
lower than forecast growth in exports and a sharp fall in total
investments, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported.
    Private consumption rose 4.1 pct during 1986 against 2.7
pct in 1985 whereas the Finance Ministry had expected an
increase of only 3.6 pct. Total investments fell 0.7 pct
against a rise of 6.3 pct in 1985. The Finance Ministry had
forecast a rise of 0.3 pct in 1986.
    Exports rose 2.1 pct last year against 2.3 pct in 1985, but
the Finance Ministry had predicted a growth of 2.8 pct.
