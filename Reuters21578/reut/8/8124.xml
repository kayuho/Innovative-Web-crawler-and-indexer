<TITLE>TAIWAN HOLDING TALKS WITH ADB, TAIWAN OFFICIAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan is holding discussions with the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) to try to settle a political
dispute over its representation in the bank, a foreign ministry
spokesman said.
    Taiwan, one of the founders of the 47-member ADB, boycotted
the annual meeting last year to protest against a decision to
change its membership name to "Taipei, China" after the admission
of Peking.
    The foreign ministry spokesman said a decision on whether
Taiwan would attend the next meeting in Japan on April 27-29
would depend on the results of the talks.
    "We are looking for a fair and just solution to the question
of representation," he said.
    In Manila, an ADB spokesman declined to comment on the
statement.
    "We have no comment at all," he said.
