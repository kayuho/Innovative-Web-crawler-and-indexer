<TITLE>CHRYSLER, LAMBORGHINI STILL IN JOINT VENTURE TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOLOGNA, Italy, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Joint venture talks that could
lead to Chrysler Corp &lt;C&gt; taking a stake in Italian car maker
&lt;Automobili Lamborghini SpA&gt; are continuing, a Lamborghini
spokesman said.
    He told Reuters the two companies are discussing a number
of topics ranging from "a joint venture in the production area
to Chrysler becoming a shareholding partner" in the Italian
firm.
    The spokesman declined to comment on whether Chrysler was
interested in acquiring control of Lamborghini or if the two
sides were close to an accord.
    He said the two companies are discussing the possibility of
jointly developing a sports car aimed primarily at the U.S.
Market.
    The spokesman said Chrysler officials in Detroit had
already visited Lamborghini's production plant in Bologna and
another visit may be scheduled.
    Lamborghini, which is controlled by the Mimran Group of
Switzerland, broke even last year on sales of 29 billion lire,
he said.
    Chrysler also holds a 15 pct interest in Italian sports car
producer &lt;Alfieri Maserati Spa&gt;.
