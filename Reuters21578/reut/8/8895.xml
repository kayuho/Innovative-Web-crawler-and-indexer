<TITLE>EC MEMBER STATES COOL ON CEREAL PLANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community (EC) member states
have generally given a cool initial reaction to proposals by
the European Commission for cereal price changes and related
measures in the coming season, EC diplomats said.
    They said that in meetings of the EC Special Committee on
Agriculture representatives of most member states had said the
changes, taken together, would have too harsh an impact on
farmers' incomes.
    Only Britain and the Netherlands had shown willingness to
accept the commission's overall package, they said.
    As well as cuts of over two pct in common prices for most
cereals, the commission proposes a limitation of intervention
to the February to March period and reduced monthly increments
in intervention prices.
    EC Farm Ministers will have a first discussion of the
proposals at a meeting beginning next Monday.
