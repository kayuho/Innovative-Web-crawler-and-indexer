<TITLE>BOND CORP HAS NO COMMENT ON ALLIED SPECULATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bond Corp Holdings Ltd  &lt;BONA.S&gt; of
Australia said it had no comment on an article in a London
evening newspaper speculating on its plans for a bid approach
to U.K. dDrinks and food giant Allied Lyons Plc &lt;ALLD.L&gt;.
    Tony Oates, Bond Corp's Executive Director for Finance and
Administration, said "The company does not comment on market
rumors or press conjecture." He added in all instances of this
kind problems are likely to arise whatever is said.
    Allied's shares were 3p up at 401p, which values the
company at around 2.75 billion stg.
    London stock market analysts specializing in brewery shares
viewed a bid from Bond, which they said has assets of around
two billion stg, as highly unlikely.
    They added that rumours of a possible bid for Allied have
surfaced from time to time in the press and the London equity
market ever since last year's thwarted approach from Elders IXL
Ltd &lt;ELXA.S&gt; of Australia.
