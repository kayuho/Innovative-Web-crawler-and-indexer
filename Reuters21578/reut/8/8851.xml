<TITLE>NV PHILIPS SHARES MOVE FROM NASDAQ TO NYSE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    EINDHOVEN, Netherlands, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch electronics group
N.V. Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken &lt;PGLO.AS&gt; said it will move
its New York share listing, currently over the counter in the
Nasdaq system, to the New York Stock Exchange.
    Philips, listed on 17 European exchanges, said the move is
part of an effort to boost its profile in the U.S., Where 10
pct of all outstanding shares are held. The NASDAQ listing will
end with the start of the NYSE listing, a spokesman said.
    The NYSE told Philips it met conditions for a big board
listing, Philips said, adding it expects the change to be
effected in April, using the symbol PHG.
