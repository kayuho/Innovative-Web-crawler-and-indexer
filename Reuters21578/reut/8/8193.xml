<TITLE>GOOD DEMAND FOR COLOMBIANS ON BREMEN MARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BREMEN, March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bremen green coffee market attracted
good buying interest for Colombian coffee last week, while
Brazils were almost neglected, trade sources said.
    Buyers were awaiting the opening of Brazil's export
registrations for May shipment, which could affect prices for
similar qualities, they said.
    Colombia opened export registrations and good business
developed with both the FNC and private shippers. Prices were
said to have been very attractive, but details were not
immediately available.
    Central Americans were sought for spot and afloat.
    In the robusta sector nearby material was rather scarce,
with turnover limited, the sources said.
    The following offers were in the market at the end of last
week, first or second hand, sellers' ideas for spot, afloat or
prompt shipment in dlrs per 50 kilos fob equivalent, unless
stated (previous week's prices in brackets) -
    Brazil unwashed German quals 100 (102), Colombia Excelso
105 (110), Salvador SHG 110 (108), Nicaragua SHG 109 (same),
Guatemala HB 111 (same), Costa Rica SHB 113 (112), Kenya AB FAQ
