<DATELINE>    BAGUIO, Philippines - </DATELINE><BODY>Military authorities say an unnamed
army captain has been arrested for involvement in last week's
bombing of the Philippine Military Academy.

ordered after a search of his home revealed bombs and
ammunition.

President Aquino said was designed as an attempt on her life.
