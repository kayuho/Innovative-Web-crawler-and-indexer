<TITLE>BERLINER BANK OUTLINES LOSSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WEST BERLIN, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Berliner Bank AG&gt; has suffered
losses of between 25 mln and 30 mln marks on credits extended
by its Stuttgart branch by bank officials who exceeded their
powers, a bank spokesman said.
    The spokesman, replying to queries about press reports,
said he could not rule out the possibility that the final loss
figure may be slightly above this range.
    Late last week the bank said only that the losses from the
credits in Stuttgart would be in the "double-digit millions."
