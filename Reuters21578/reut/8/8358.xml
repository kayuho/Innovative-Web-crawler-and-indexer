<TITLE>SUMMAGRAPHICS CONTENDS PATENT SUIT INVALID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FAIRFIELD, Conn., March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Summagraphics Corp&gt; said the
patent infringement suit filed by Lockheed Corp's &lt;LK&gt; Sanders
Rogers Associates unit is invalid.
    Summagraphics said it will seek an injunction to stop
Sanders from continuing with its suit.
    The company said prior to Sanders filing a patent for an
electromagnetic digitizing apparatus, it was working with
technology that was patented and subsequently reflected in the
Rogers patent.
