<TITLE>BORDEN &lt;BN&gt; PLANT FINED ON POLLUTION VIOLATIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency said Borden Inc was fined 545,000 dlrs for the delay of
the installation of pollution controls in its canning plant in
Lyons, N.Y.
    The EPA said the U.S. District Court in Rochester, N.Y.,
assessed the penalty in connection with its failure to comply
with EPA-approved air quality regulations by July 1, 1980.
    After Borden sought relief through the courts, a final
compliance date was set for Dec 1, 1984, the EPA said.
    The EPA said that Borden did not adequately correct the
problems by the date and rejected Borden's argument that it had
made a good faith effort to rectify the problems.
    Borden sold the facility to C-B Foods in January 1986, the
EPA said.
