<TITLE>FORD &lt;F&gt; CREDIT UNIT SELLS NOTES AT 8.13 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ford Motor Credit Co, a unit of Ford

    The notes have an eight pct coupon and were priced at
99.125 to yield 88 basis points over comparable Treasuries.

unit's equal-sized, same-maturity offering on January 6 that
was priced to yield 7.948 pct. This deal was rated A-2 by
Moody's and AA-minus by Standard and Poor's.
    Non-callable for five years, today's issue is rated A-1 by
Moody's and AA-minus by S and P.
