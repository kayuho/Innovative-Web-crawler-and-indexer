<TITLE>MIDAM SETS TRADING AT NEW CBT LOCATION MARCH 30</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Midamerica Commodity Exchange, an
affiliate of the Chicago Board of Trade, CBT, that offers
smaller versions of several futures contracts traded on other
exchanges, will begin trading in its new quarters within the
CBT complex on March 30, the CBT announced.
    Concurrent with the move from its current site a few blocks
away, the trading hours of the Midam's Treasury bond futures
contract will expand to between 0720 and 1515 local time from
0800 to 1415 currently.
    The Midam's T-bond contract has a face value half the size
of the CBT's 100,000 dlr T-bond contract, the most active
futures contract traded.
    The Midam also offers smaller-sized futures and options on
currencies, precious metals, grains and livestock.
