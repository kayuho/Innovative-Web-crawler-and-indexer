<TITLE>BOLIVIAN MINERS, GOVERNMENT CONTINUE STRIKE TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LA PAZ, March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>Union leaders of 9,000 miners employed
by the state corporation Comibol and government representatives
will resume talks tomorrow in an effort to end a six-day strike
over pay, a spokesman for the miners said.
    A labour ministry spokesman said the talks, which began
today, were suspended when labour minister Alfredo Franco left
to attend a session of Congress also attended by visiting West
German President Richard von Weizsaecker.
    But mining minister Jaime Villalobos told reporters an
agreement in principle on the rehabilitation of Comibol had
been reached. He did not elaborate.
