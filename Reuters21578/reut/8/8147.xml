<TITLE>U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 800 MLN STG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it forecast a
shortage of around 800 mln stg in the money market today.
    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
around 1.18 billion stg while bankers balances below target
will take out some 20 mln stg.
    Partly offseting these outflows, a fall in note circulation
and exchequer transactions will add some 355 and 55 mln stg to
the system respectively.
