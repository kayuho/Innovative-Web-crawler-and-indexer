<TITLE>CANADA PLANS TWO BOND AUCTIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada plans an auction of three-year
bonds March 31 and an auction of seven-year bonds April 1, the
finance department said.
    Further details would be announced March 25 on the bonds
that will be dated and delivered April 16, 1987.
    The department said the issues are contingent upon final

authority for fiscal 1987 (March 31) and borrowing authority
for fiscal 1988.
