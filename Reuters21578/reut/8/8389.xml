<TITLE>ROSTENKOWSKI URGES HONESTY IN FUTURES INDUSTRY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOCA RATON, Fla., March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) said Congress would more
readily respond to the needs of the U.S. futures industry to be
internationally competitive if the industry showed a
willingness to do its business honestly.
    Rostenkowski told the Futures Industry Association that if
other countries were relaxing futures regulations "because ours
are being tightened, so that they can take a competitive
advantage, I think we (Congress) have a responsibility to keep
you out in front."
    But he told the futures leaders that they "have a more
important reponsibility to do your business honestly. You can't
ignore the trader who is improperly using his opportunity."
