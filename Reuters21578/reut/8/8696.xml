<TITLE>IRAN SAID TO TEST FIRE SILKWORM MISSILE IN HORMUZ</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iran has test-fired its newly acquired
Silkworm anti-shipping missile in the Strait of Hormuz and has
set up at least two land-based launching sites in the area, a
British naval source in the Gulf said.
    The source, who declined to be identified, said Iran had
fired the Chinese-made missile at a hulk off its southern Gulf
naval port of Bandar Abbas and scored a hit.
    "These missiles pack a fairly big punch," he told Reuters.
"There is no doubt they could be used to target (shipping)
across the Strait of Hormuz."
