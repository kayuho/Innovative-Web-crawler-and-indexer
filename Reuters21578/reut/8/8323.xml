<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried
Martens said government austerity programs adopted in the last

    Martens told Belgian television the austerity measures had
brought the country's balance of payments from deficit to
surplus, helped reduce inflation and boosted economic growth.
