<TITLE>CAESARS &lt;CAW&gt; HAS NO COMMENT ON MTS TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>Caesars World Inc declined
immediate comment on news that Martin Sosnoff's &lt;MTS
Acquisition Corp&gt; has held preliminary talks with two companies
on the possibility of forming a joint venture to pursue the
acquisition of Caesars.
    Earlier today MTS said it held talks with Pratt Hotel Corp
&lt;PRAT&gt; and Southmark Corp &lt;SM&gt; on forming a venture to acquire
Caesars.
    MTS also reported that it received a "negligible" number of
Caesars World shares in response to its 28 dlr per share tender
offer.
    Earlier this month Caesars World rejected the Sosnoff
takeover bid and said it is considering alternatives that
include a restructuring or sale of the company to another
party.
