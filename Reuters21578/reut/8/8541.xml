<TITLE>DATA CARD &lt;DATC&gt; SEES LOWER YEAREND RESULTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>Data Card Corp said it does not
expect to meet its earnings and revenue targets for the fiscal
year ending March 28.
    Earlier, the company said it expected earnings per share
from continuing operations to be 35 to 45 cts a share. Now it
sees that figure at 15 cts a share, or about 1.5 mln dlrs.
    Data Card said it expects revenues for the year in the
range of 170 mln to 175 mln dlrs, down from a previous estimate
of 180 mln to 185 mln dlrs.
    It said integration of Addressograph Farrington Inc, a
private company acquired on Aug 25, 1986, is proving more
difficult than expected. The company reported revenues of 154
mln dlrs and net income of 10.6 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986 ended
March 26, 1986.
