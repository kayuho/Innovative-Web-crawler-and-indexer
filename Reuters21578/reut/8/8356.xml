<TITLE>BANK OF FINLAND ISSUES CDS FOR FIRST TIME</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HELSINKI, March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Finland issued for the
first time a small amount of its own certificates of deposit
following its decision last Friday to enter the interbank
market by buying and selling CDs, a Central Bank official said.
    The official said the volume of the Central Bank CDs, which
had a maturity of three months, was still small as today's
transactions were seen as an exercise for what is still a new
market for the Bank of Finland.
