<TITLE>IRAQ REPLACES OIL MINISTER IN BIG GOVT SHUFFLE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAGHDAD, March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iraqi President Saddam Hussein carried
out his first major government shakeup in five years tonight,
naming a new oil minister in shuffling three posts.
    One minister was dropped in the shuffle, announced in a
presidential decree. It gave no reason for the changes in the
government of the Arab Baath Socialist Party which has ruled
Iraq since a revolution in 1968.
    The decree named the head of the Iraqi National Oil Company
(INOC), Isam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalaby, to take over as oil
minister replacing Qassem Ahmed Taqi.
    Taqi, appointed oil minister in the last significant
government reorganization in 1982, was moved to be minister of
heavy industries.
