<TITLE>CANADIAN BONDS CLOSE LOWER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canadian bonds extended mild losses from
early activity to close up to 3/4 of a point lower in moderate
trading, dealers said.
    The decline reflected investor concern about economic
trends, coupled with the sharp afternoon downturn in U.S. bond
markets on firm oil prices and the uncertain outlook for the
U.S. dollar, traders said.
    The benchmark Canada 9-1/2 pct of 2001, off 1/8 in early
trading, closed behind 5/8 at 105-3/4 7/8, while the 8-1/2 pct
of 2011 lost 3/4 from last night to 96-5/8 7/8.
