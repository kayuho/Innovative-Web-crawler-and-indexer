<TITLE>N.Y. COTTON FUTURES STEADY IN EARLY TRADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cotton futures were steady this morning
on commission house buying. But trade selling was keeping gains
to a minimum, brokers said.
    There was no news, but brokers said the market is 
technically weak and in search of a bottom. Recent news of poor
export sales remained a damper, brokers said.
    Cotton for May delivery was up 0.25 cent at 56.05 cents a
lb in a 56.30 to 55.80 cent range.
    December delivery was up 0.40 cent at 55.15 cents.
