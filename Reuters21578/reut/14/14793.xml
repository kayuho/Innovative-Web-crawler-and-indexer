<TITLE>GOLD OPENS FIRMER IN HONG KONG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gold opened firmer in fairly active
trading on continued buying interest and light short covering
following the sharp rise in New York, dealers said.
    They said gold drew its strength from the buoyant silver
market which has been underpinned by speculative purchases.
    The metal opened at 422.80/423.20 U.S. Dlrs an ounce
against New York's 422.25/423.25 close and the 420.00/50 finish
here yesterday.
    On the local market gold opened 26 H.K. Dlrs higher at
3,930 H.K. Dlrs a tael.
