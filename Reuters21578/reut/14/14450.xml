<TITLE>MINNEAPOLIS SPRING WHEAT CLOSES HIGHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spring wheat futures closed 1-3/4 to
3/4 cents higher as some exporter pricing and firm cash demand
lent support to an otherwise quiet market, traders said. May
closed 1-3/4 cents higher at 2.85-1/4 dlrs.
    The 14 pct spring wheat cash basis was steady at 38 cents
over May despite increased receipts of 186 cars. Milling durum
was steady at 3.95 to 4.00 dlrs and terminal quality was
unchanged at 3.55 dlrs for Minneapolis and 3.80 dlrs Duluth.
    Other quotes were unchanged with Duluth sunseed at 7.80
dlrs, number one and two oats at 1.55 to 1.66 dlrs, feed barley
at 1.75 dlrs for Duluth and malting barley at 2.00 to 2.05 dlrs.
