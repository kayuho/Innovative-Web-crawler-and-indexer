<TITLE>SENATE FARM LEADER URGES HELP FOR RURAL AMERICA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee
chairman said he wanted to develop a plan to help rural
America, which he said has been neglected by the Reagan
administration.
     "I hope to develop a sound and comprehensive plan to
revitalize rural America.... We need a renewed national
commitment to rural America and we will have one," Sen. Patrick
Leahy (D-Vt.) told a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing.
    Leahy faulted the Reagan administration for having no
strategy to revitalize rural America.
    Leahy added that some rural countries were losing
population and this was contributing to the economic decline.
