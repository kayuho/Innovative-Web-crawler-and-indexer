<TITLE>WINNIPEG OILSEED FUTURES END UP, GRAINS MIXED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WINNIPEG, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Winnipeg oilseed futures closed higher
in sympathy with strength in the Chicago soybean complex, with
grains mixed in quiet trade.
    Rapeseed futures ended with gains of 2.60 to 3.30 dlrs per
tonne, with flaxseed up 4.90 to 4.00 dlrs. Commission house and
commercial short-covering overcame moderate elevator house
hedge selling in both oilseeds, traders said. Continued
Japanese crusher export buying added support to rapeseed, with
locals net buyers in flaxseed.
    Rye finished unchanged to up 0.10 dlr, with feed grains
ranging from down 0.60 dlr in May wheat to up 0.30 in new
December barley. Strength in new crop Chicago corn futures kept
deferreds here strong relative to nearbys. May and July oats
again set new contract lows.
