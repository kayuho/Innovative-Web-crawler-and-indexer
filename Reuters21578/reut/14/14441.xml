<TITLE>ATT &lt;T&gt; GETS GEORGIA RATE REDUCTION APPROVAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATLANTA, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Telephone and Telegraph Co said
the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) approved its 4.1
mln dlr rate restructuring proposal to reduce intrastate long
distance rates by about 4.4 pct.
    ATT said it will file new prices at the PSC in August to
meet a Sept. 1 effective date set by the commission.
    The telephone company said it asked the PSC on Nov. 7 for
permission to increase its prices for intrastate private line
services, used mainly by large business customers, which ATT
said were priced below its access costs.
    "Private line service has been grossly underpriced since
1984, and, therefore, it has been subsidized by all long
distance users," Terry Hobbs, assistant vice president said.
    "As a result of today's PSC decision to allow our private
line service prices to cover their access costs, these
subsidies will end and we'll be able to reduce basic long
distance rates for everyone," he added.
