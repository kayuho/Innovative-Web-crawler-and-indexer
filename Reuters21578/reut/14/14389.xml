<TITLE>IOWA GRAIN ELEVATOR EXPLODES, BURNS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANCROFT, Iowa, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>An explosion and fire today
damaged a grain elevator in Bancroft, Iowa, destroying
thousands of bushels of grain, authorities said.
    The pre-dawn explosion ripped the wooden elevator open, and
a fire that followed continued burning at late morning but had
been contained, according to a dispatcher at the Algona Police
Department.
    No injuries were reported at the Lone Rock Coop facility.
    The dispatcher said the elevator was filled with corn, and
a nearby drying building holding soybeans was on fire.
    The explosion was the second in four days in Iowa following
the destruction of an Archer Daniels Midland elevator in
Burlington last Friday.
