<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN SHIP BAN ENDS BUT NSW PORTS HIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Tug crews in New South Wales (NSW),
Victoria and Western Australia yesterday lifted their ban on
foreign-flag ships carrying containers but NSW ports are still
being disrupted by a separate dispute, shipping sources said.
    The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented
the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said.
    The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration
Commission today.
    Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the
ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said.
    The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week
of action called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council to
protest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws.
    The shipping sources said the various port unions appear to
be taking it in turn to work for a short time at the start of
each shift and then to walk off.
    Cargo handling in the ports has been disrupted, with
container movements most affected, but has not stopped
altogether, they said.
    They said they could not say how long the disruption will
go on and what effect it will have on shipping movements.
