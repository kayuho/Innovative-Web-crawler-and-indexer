<TITLE>LIVE HOG FUTURES HIGHER EARLY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Live Hog futures ran up for gains of
0.57 to 0.07 cent in eary trade paced by April and June.
    Fairly active demand reflected strength in cash hogs and
the continued discount of futures to cash. The start of
fieldwork limited farmer movement of hogs to market and
prompted packers to bid up for hogs. Mostly steady to firm cash
pork products added to support, traders said.
    However, prices slipped from the highs in latest trade as
commercial profit-taking developed. Some selling was also
attributed to expectations that cash ham prices will be falling
soon on a seasonal basis, they said.
    Thomson and RBH bought while Packers Trading and Refco
sold. Stotler spread long June/short April, they added.
