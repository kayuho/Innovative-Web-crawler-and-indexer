<TITLE>CHINA INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT RISES IN FIRST QUARTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>China's industrial output rose 14.1 pct
in the first quarter of 1987 against the same 1986 period, the
People's Daily said.
    Its overseas edition said the growth rate, which compares
with a target of seven pct for the whole of 1987, was "rather
high" but the base in the first quarter of 1986 was on the low
side. Industrial output grew 4.4 pct in the first quarter of
1986.

normal but product quality and efficiency need further
