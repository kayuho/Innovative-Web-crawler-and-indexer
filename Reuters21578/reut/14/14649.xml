<TITLE>N.Y. OILSEEDS REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dealers said very little business was
done in local oilseeds markets.
    Coconut oil was nominally 18 cents a lb for April/May
shipment, CIF, New York/Gulf, brokers said.
    Crude wet-milled corn oil, FOB, Midwest points, was
nominally 20-3/4 cents a lb for nearby shipment. Based on that
price, dealers said refined corn oil, FOB, New York, was
nominally 27.15 cents a lb.
    Peanut oil remained offered at 24-1/2 cents a lb for nearby
shipment but dealers said market interest was closer to 24
cents.
