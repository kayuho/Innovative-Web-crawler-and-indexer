<TITLE>LONDON COFFEE CLOSES FIRMER IN DULL TRADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Robusta futures closed firmer after a
lacklustre session, ranging 19 to three stg per tonne higher.
Second position July settled up 19 at 1,270 stg.
    The rise mostly reflected a technical consolidation of
recent losses, dealers said. Roaster interest appeared to be
tapering off and origin offers were insignificant, providing
little trading incentive.
    Now that Brazil has closed its May registrations, the
market is awaiting fresh fundamental news, they added.
    Volume totalled 4,170 lots, including six options and 1,600
crosses.
