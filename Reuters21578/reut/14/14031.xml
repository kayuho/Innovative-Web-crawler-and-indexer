<TITLE>PORTUGUESE AIRLINE CONFIRMS AIRBUS A310 ORDER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Portugal's "flag carrier" airline TAP has
confirmed an order for three Airbus Industrie &lt;AINP.PA&gt;
A310-300 passenger aircraft, British Aerospace Plc &lt;BAEL.L&gt;
(BAe), one of four shareholders in the international Airbus
consortium, said.
    BAe said in a statement TAP had also taken options on
another two Airbus aircraft, either the existing A310-300
medium range craft or the long-range four-engined A340 which
Airbus hopes to launch in 1992, depending on the airline's
needs.
    BAe said the firm order confirmed a commitment taken by TAP
in January. Details of the value of the contract, delivery
dates or which engine would power the aircraft were not
available.
