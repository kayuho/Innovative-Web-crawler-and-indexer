<TITLE>AMATIL PROPOSES TWO-FOR-FIVE BONUS SHARE ISSUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Amatil Ltd &lt;AMAA.S&gt; said it proposes to
make a two-for-five bonus issue out of its revaluation reserve
to shareholders registered May 26.
    Shareholders will be asked to approve the issue and an
increase in authorised capital to 175 mln shares from 125 mln
at a general meeting on May 1, it said in a statement.
    The new shares will rank for dividends declared after
October 31. Amatil, in which B.A.T. Industries Plc &lt;BTI.L&gt;
holds a 41 pct stake, said it does not expect to maintain its
latest annual dividend rate of 29 cents a share on the enlarged
capital.
