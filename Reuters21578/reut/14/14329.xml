<TITLE>LME NICKEL CLOSE SLIPS TO DAY'S LOW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>LME nickel ended the afternoon rings with
three months metal indicated from 2,355 to 2,360 stg per tonne,
equivalent to 1.7175 dlrs per lb, unchanged from yesterday's
afternoon kerb close.
    The afternoon first ring slipped to the day's low of 2,355
in very quiet trading which mostly comprised miscellaneous
carries, traders said. The session high of 2,370 stg was
reached near the official morning ring close on trade buying
before speculative profittaking and hedging operations halted
the advance, traders said. Analysts said the brief rise above
the 1.72 dlr level gave the market a slightly bullish
appearance.
    There was still borrowing interest over the last two
delivery months at a narrower contango of five stg.
