<TITLE>IRAQ REPORTS FIERCE FIGHTING TO REMOVE IRANIANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAGHDAD, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iraq said its forces were battling to
dislodge Iranian troops from territory they gained during a new
three-pronged offensive on the war front near the southern city
of Basra.
    The third High Command communique issued during the day
said the Iranians launched a major overnight assault on the
fronts of three Iraqi divisions, the Qutaiba, Muthanna and
Mohammed al-Qassem forces.
    The communique said the Iranian troops which attacked the
Qutaiba front were annihilated but the invading force managed
to gain some footholds on the other fronts.
    "Fierce fighting has been raging since dawn today and all
morning where our forces succeeded in dislodging the Iranians
from all the positions they gained at the Muthanna front and
the situation ended in Iraq's favour," the communique said.
    It said Iraqi forces were continuing counter-attacks to
drive the Iranians from the few positions they were still
holding on the front of the Mohammed al-Qassem forces.
    The precise locations of the three fronts were not given. A
previous Iranian offensive launched in January towards Basra,
Iraq's second city, was halted with Baghdad saying the Iranians
had gained only a narrow strip of Iraqi territory.
