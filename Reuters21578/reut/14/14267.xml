<DATELINE>    RICHARDSON, Texas, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>L.M. Ericsson Telephone Co
said it has received a contract to provide U S West Inc with
AXE digital central office switching equipment for use in
Idaho, replacing 50 older electro-mechanical switches.

    The company said U S West's Mountain Bell will place the
first AXE in service before year-end and the project is to be
completed by the end of 1991.

agreement between Mountain Bell and the Idaho Public Utilities

telephone network to digital from analog technology over the
next five years.
