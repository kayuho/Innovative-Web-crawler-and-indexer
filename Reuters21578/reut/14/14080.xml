<TITLE>HIGHWOOD &lt;HIWDF&gt; COMMENTS ON SHARE PRICE RISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Highwood Resources Ltd said it is not
aware of any material change in the company's affairs to
account for recent trading activity in the company's shares,
but said it anticipates being a future producer of minerals
used in electronic superconductors.
    Recent widespread publicity concerning superconductors
suggest a greatly increased demand for yttrium and lanthanide
minerals, Highwood said.
    The company said it is developing such deposits at Thor
Lake, Northwest Territories in cooperation with Hecla Mining
Co, of Idaho.
    Highwood Resources said the deposits contain beryllium,
yttrium, lanthanides, niobium and tantalum. It did not
immediately elaborate on estimated reserves on the property.
    Highwood shares traded earlier on the Toronto Stock
Exchange at 6-7/8, up 1/8, after climbing 1-1/8 in yesterday's
session.
