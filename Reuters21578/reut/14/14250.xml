<TITLE>LONDON GOLD CLOSES OFF LOWS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gold bullion ended the day easier but off
lows after strengthening during late afternoon trading in
sympathy with firmer values on Comex, dealers said.
    The metal closed at 420.00/420.50 dlrs an ounce, up on the
afternoon fix of 418.50, but still below last night's close of
421.50/422.
    It eased during the morning as dealers traded on the
gold/silver ratio, buying cheaper silver and selling gold.
Trading was quiet with interest in silver far outweighing gold.
    Gold was at its high for the day at the opening and slipped
to its low at the afternoon fix.
    Platinum ended the day at 565.50/566.50 dlrs an ounce
little changed from the afternoon fix of 566.35 or the morning
setting of 565.75, dealers said.
