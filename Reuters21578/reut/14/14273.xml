<TITLE>MIDDAY WINNIPEG OILSEEDS HIGHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WINNIPEG, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Winnipeg oilseeds were higher, with
rapeseed gaining 2.10 to 2.50 dlrs a bushel and flaxseed up
1.50 to 2.70.
    Oilseeds were supported by the rally in the Chicago soy
complex, trade sources said. Further, recently active producer
selling subsided, while exporters provided underlying support
in flaxseed and crushers bought rapeseed, they said.
    Feed grain trade was quiet with locals and commission
houses dominating activity.
    Rye fell 0.10 to 0.20.
    Barley ranged 0.40 lower to 0.40 higher. Oats ranged
unchanged to 0.30 lower. Wheat fell 0.20 to 0.50.
