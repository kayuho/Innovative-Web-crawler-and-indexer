<TITLE>NY COCOA FUTURES CLOSE MIXED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cocoa futures drifted into a dull
finish, settling at nine dlrs lower to seven higher, with most
contracts near unchanged from midday levels.
    May closed nine dlrs lower at 1,925 dlrs. Estimated volume
was 1,461 contracts.
    Light selling based on weak London prices and continued
offers by West African origins applied light pressure.
    A report from London that traders question the supportive
potential of newly-negotiated buffer stock rules was also
depressing to prices, analysts said.
    Bahia arrivals now total a cumulative 6,475,385 bags,
private Brazil trade sources said, half a mln bags above the
year ago count.
