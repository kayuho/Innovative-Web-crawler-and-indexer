<TITLE>MEAD &lt;MEA&gt; EXPECTS IMPROVED EARNINGS THIS YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DAYTON, Ohio, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mead Corp said the outlook for its
major paper markets looks strong for the second quarter and
augurs well for its earnings in 1987.
    "The generally strong outlook bodes well for significantly
improved earnings this year," Burnell Roberts, chairman and
chief executive officer said.
    Earlier, the company reported first quarter earnings of
34.2 mln dlrs, or 1.09 dlrs a share, versus 20.3 mln dlrs, or
65 cts a share, in last year's first quarter.
    In 1986 the company reported earnings from continuing
operations of 109.3 mln dlrs, or 3.50 dlrs a share.
    Mead said its first quarter benefitted from stronger market
conditions and improved operations.
    "The combination of capital improvement programs and more
employee involvement has been paying off throughout our paper
operations," Roberts said.
    He added that Mead's pulp and paperboard businesses are
operating well as prices have improved and strong demand has
placed most products in a sold-out position through the middle
of the year.
    Mead said sales of its unbleached coated paperboard was
particularly strong, up 13 pct versus the first quarter 1986.
