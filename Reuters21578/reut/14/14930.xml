<TITLE>HIGHER 1986 PROFIT FOR DUTCH CHEMICAL FIRM DSM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HEERLEN, Netherlands, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The fully state-owned Dutch
chemical firm NV DSM &lt;DSMN.AS&gt; said its 1986 net profit rose to
412 mln guilders from 402 mln in 1985, while turnover fell to
17.7 billion guilders in 1986 from 24.1 billion in 1985.
    The company said 1986 dividend, which will be paid to the
Dutch state in its capacity of the firm's sole shareholder,
would be raised to 98 mln guilders from 70 mln guilders in
1985.
    In an initial comment on its 1986 results, DSM said the
drop in 1986 turnover had been caused mainly by losses in the
company's fertilizer division.
