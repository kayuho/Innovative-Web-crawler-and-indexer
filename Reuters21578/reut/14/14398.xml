<TITLE>COMEX COPPER FUTURES DROP LATE, SETTLE LOWER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Comex copper futures settled weaker
after dropping to new session lows on trade selling, which
entered a few minutes before the close, brokers said.
    May delivery slipped to 62.05 cents before settling at
62.30 cents a lb, off 0.35 cent.
    May's high was its opening price of 62.85 cents.
    Indications that commission house selling would enter above
that level kept a lid on the market, brokers said. Otherwise,
dealings were featureless, they said.

points yesterday.
