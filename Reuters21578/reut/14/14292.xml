<TITLE>LIVE CATTLE FUTURES MIXED AT MIDSESSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Live cattle futures continued to trade
unevenly and at midsession prices stood 0.17 cent higher to
0.25 lower with spot April pacing the gain and distant April
off most.
    Mixed profit-taking continued to partly offset demand
prompted by further gains in cash cattle and private reports of
higher cash beef prices. All months posted new season's highs
early before slipping, traders said.
    Market ready supplies of cattle remain tight and a rising
wholesale carcass beef and boxed beef market is prompting good
packer interest for cash cattle. Strong stoppers of deliveries
added to strength in April, they said.
