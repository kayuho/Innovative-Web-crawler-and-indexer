<DATELINE>    ARLINGTON, Va., April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Allied-Signal Inc's Bendix Test
Systems Division is cutting between 75 and 125 employes as part
of its streamlining efforts.
    Bendix, which is part of the Aircraft Systems Co of
Allied-Signal's Aerospace's Bendix sector, said the cuts would
create a more cost-effective unit. It said employment is
expected to remain at approximately 1,200 employes.
    The reductions began last month when the division announced
a voluntary retirement program for eligible employes.
