<TITLE>USDA ANNOUNCES WORLD MARKET RICE PRICES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department
announced the following prevailing world market prices of rice
on a loan-rate basis, with previous prices --
    -- Long grain whole kernels 5.87 cts per lb vs 5.70
    -- Medium grain whole kernels 5.28 cts per lb vs 5.12
    -- Short grain whole kernels  5.22 cts per lb vs 5.06

    The prices will remain in effect for a week, but new prices
could be announced earlier if warranted, USDA said.
