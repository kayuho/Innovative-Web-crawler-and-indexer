<TITLE>BOEING PROPOSES WESTLAND DEAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Boeing Co &lt;BA.N&gt; said its Boeing Vertol
helicopter unit proposed that U.K. Helicopter maker &lt;Westland
Plc&gt; should build up to a third of all future Chinooks for
Britain's airforce.
    A Boeing statement made here said the work would involve up
to 12,500 man-hours per machine, and solve some of Westland's
short-term workload problems. It comes amid speculation that
Britain may pull out of the European EH-101 project, with the
possibility of up to 2,000 Westland job losses.
    Westland was rescued last year by United Technologies Corp
&lt;UTX.N&gt; and Fiat Spa &lt;FIAT.MI&gt;.
