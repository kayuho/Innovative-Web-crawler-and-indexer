U.S SPOT PRODUCTS--MORNING--APRIL 07 1100 EST
    Spot oil product markets are firmer than yesterday, in thin
trading, brokers said. they said prices are up mainly on crude
strength because there is still little interest in moving cash
products.
    traders said product inventories are still ample and
players don't see any reason to buy right now.
    spot gasoline is stronger than two oil this morning,
gaining about 0.50 cent a gallon in nyh and 0.40 in the usg.
new york barrels were still about one cent under futures, at
52.45 cts/gal, while us gulf sellers were asking around a 1.60
discount, or 51.85.
    spot two oil rose 0.35 cent in ny harbor, to 49.35. usg two
oil is up 0.15 cent from monday, at 46.95.
