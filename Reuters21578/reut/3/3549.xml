<TITLE>CANADA'S MULRONEY MAKES SENIOR STAFF CHANGES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     OTTAWA, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
announced a major shakeup in the ranks of his key advisers 
after weeks of continuing criticism of his government.
     Mulroney announced the departure of his senior policy
advisor, the resignation of his press secretary and the
reassignment of his communications director.
     Mulroney's Progressive Conservative government, shaken by
a series of cabinet resignations and allegations of corruption,
has been trailing the opposition parties for months in public
opinion polls.
     The prime minister, who led the Conservatives to a
landslide victory in the 1984 general election, had been urged
by party loyalists to make major changes within his office.
     A cabinet shuffle is expected later this month in advance
of more personnel changes within Mulroney's office as the prime
minister seeks to regain public confidence.
     The next election is expected sometime in 1988, although
it could be delayed until mid-1989.
