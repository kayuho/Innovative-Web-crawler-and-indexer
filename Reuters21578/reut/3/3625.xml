<TITLE>SIGMA MINES DETAILS GOLD ORE RESERVES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Sigma Mines (Quebec) Ltd&gt;, 65 pct
owned by Dome Mines Ltd &lt;DM&gt;, said its Sigma Mine had proven
and probable reserves at the end of 1986 of 4,902,940 tons,
with an average grade of 0.139 ounces of gold a ton.
    Sigma said the reserves are equivalent to 10 years future
production at current milling rates.
    The reserves comprise 1,640,779 tons proven reserves
grading an average of 0.163 ounces of gold a ton and 3,262,161
tons probable reserves grading an average of 0.127 ounces of
gold a ton.
    Sigma said it changed its 1986 reserve reporting method
following Dome Mines previously reported move to adopt general
industry practice of reporting proven and probable ore
reserves.
    Prior to 1986, Sigma conservatively reported only proven
reserves that could be mined without future development costs.
    Proven reserves as of December 31, 1985 were 978,000 tons
grading an average of 0.194 ounces of gold a ton, equivalent to
about two years future production.
