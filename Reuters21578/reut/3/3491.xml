<TITLE>QUEENSLAND PRESS BOARD RECOMMENDS MURDOCH OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRISBANE, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>The &lt;Queensland Press Ltd&gt; (QPL) board
said it unanimously recommended the one billion dlr takeover
bid by &lt;Cruden Investments Pty Ltd&gt;, a family company of News
Corp Ltd &lt;NCPA.S&gt; chief executive Rupert Murdoch.
    The 23 dlrs a share cash-only offer is nearly double the
market price before News announced its now-completed bid for
The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd &lt;HWTA.S&gt; in early December and
no other offer is likely, it said in a statement.
    Independent adviser, &lt;Wardley Australia Ltd&gt;, had also
concluded the offer was fair and reasonable, it added.
    QPL is already owned 48.3 pct by HWT.
