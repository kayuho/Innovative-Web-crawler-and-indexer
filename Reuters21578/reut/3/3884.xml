<TITLE>INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS MLP &lt;INP&gt; MAKES CASH PAYOUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NORCROSS, Ga., March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Intelligent Systems Master
Limited Partnership said it will make a cash distribution of 25
cts a unit in early April to unitholders of record as of March
31.
    The company said continued strength in its results prompted
the move.
    Intelligent Systems added that if current plans to sell
some of its assets, as previously announced, are successful, it
may make further distributions estimated at 15 cts to 25 cts a
unit.
    Earlier, the company reported fiscal third quarter ended
December 31 net income of 2.3 mln dlrs, or 20 cts a share, up
from fiscal 1985 third quarter results of 563,000 dlrs, or five
cts a share.
    In addition, it reported fiscal 1986 nine months' net
income of 4.4 mln dlrs, or 40 cts a share, versus a loss of 1.1
mln dlrs, or 10 cts a share, in fiscal 1985's first three
quarters.
