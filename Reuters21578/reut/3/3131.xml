<TITLE>LLOYDS BANK MATCHES BASE RATE CUT TO 10.5 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lloyds Bank Plc &lt;LLOY.L&gt; said it is
cutting its base lending rate to 10.5 pct from 11 pct,
effective tomorrow.
    The reduction follows similar moves from the three other
British clearing banks.
    National Westminster Bank Plc &lt;NWBL.L&gt; led the way this
morning after the Bank of England lowered its dealing rates in
a signal that it would tolerate a half percentage point
reduction.
    The central bank's surprise signal followed its strenuous
efforts last week to prevent market forces from bringing down
base rates before the U.K. Budget on March 17.
