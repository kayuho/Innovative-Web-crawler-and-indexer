<TITLE>KOEHLER RESIGNS AFTER ONE-WEEK AS REAGAN AIDE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>White House communications director
John Koehler resigned after just one week in the job, saying
President Reagans' new chief of staff Howard Baker had a right
to appoint his own team.
    Koehler was hired to replace Patrick Buchanan as Reagan's
communications chief a few days before Donald Regan quit as the
president's top aide.
    "I don't feel I've been jerked around ... I recognize that
Senator Baker must have people around him for the next 22
months that he's known for a long time, that he understands,
that he's comfortable with and who are comfortable with him,"
said Koehler during an appearance in the White House press
room.
