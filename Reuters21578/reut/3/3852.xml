<TITLE>PRE-PAID LEGAL &lt;PPD&gt; SEES HIGHER SALES GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pre-Paid Legal Services Inc chairman
Harland Stonecipher said the company's sales growth rate for
each of the next five years would substantially exceed the
average 100 pct recorded over each of the last few years.
    Addressing analysts, Stonecipher declined to give specific
figures but attributed his optimism to a recent loan agreement
with I.C.H. Corp &lt;ICH&gt;, under which Pre-Paid is slated to
receive 10 mln dlrs.
    In 1986, Pre-Paid earned 2.5 mln dlrs on sales of 42.4 mln
dlrs compared to net of 1.5 mln dlrs on sales of 19.8 mln dlrs
in 1985.
    Stonecipher said the company's product will be marketed
through at least two I.C.H. subsidiaries. The agreement with
I.C.H. will provide access to all 50 states from Pre-Paid's 
present coverage in 22 states, he said.
    Pre-Paid provides insurance for legal services primarily in
the private sector.
