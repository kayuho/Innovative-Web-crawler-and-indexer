<TITLE>AIDE SAYS FRANCE SUPPORTS OIL AND FATS TAX</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>France supports the European Commission's
plans for a European Community (EC) fats and oils tax but
objects to some of its oilseeds proposals, Yves Van Haecke, an
aide to French agriculture minister Francois Guillaume said.
    He told a general assembly of France's Oilseeds Federation
(FFCOP) that a suppression of monthly increases of oilseed
support prices, for example, was unacceptable.
    French oilseeds experts added the principle of a single tax
regardless of varying quality was clumsy and capable of
unneccessarily alienating exporters such as the U.S.
