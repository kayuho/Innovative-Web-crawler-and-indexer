<TITLE>ALLEGHENY &lt;AG&gt; AIMS TO DIVEST MORE BUSINESSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>   PITTSBURGH, Penn., March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Allegheny International Inc,
the consumer products concern that today announced a merger
agreement with a First Boston Corp &lt;FBC&gt; affiliate in a deal
worth about 500 mln dlrs, said it intends to divest more units
as a way to increase profits.
    "We're going to reduce AI to a size consistent with our
financial resources," said Chairman Oliver S. Travers.
    "We have made a conscious, strategic choice to become a
smaller, financially sound, consumer products company which
operates predominantly in the stable political and economic
environment of North America," he said.
