<TITLE>ELI LILLY AND CO &lt;LLY&gt; GETS DRUG APPROVAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    INDIANAPOLIS, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eli Lilly and Co said it obtained
approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Adminstration to market
the natural sequence human growth hormone, humatrope, made by
recombinant DNA technolgoy.
    The company said humatrope is identical in chemistry and
structure to the growth hormone produced by the human body. It
is the only commercially available biosysnthetic human growth
hormone that is identical to naturally-occurring growth
hormone, according to the company.
    It said humatrope is indicated only for the long term
treatment of children who have growth failure due to an
inadequate secretion of the body's own normal growth hormone.
    Humatrope joins humulin, human insulin in Eli Lilly and
Co's line of human health care products of recombinant DNA
origin.
