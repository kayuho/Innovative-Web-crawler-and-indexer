<DATELINE>    UTRECHT, Netherlands, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>SHV Holdings NV said it is
withdrawing its take-over bid for Imperial Continental Gas

of pledges sought from IC Gas shareholders.
    SHV said in a statement it had sought to gain 750,000 IC
Gas shares under a 700p offer for IC Gas ordinary stock but was
informed that level was not reached when the deadline expired.
