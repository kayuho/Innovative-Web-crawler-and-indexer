<TITLE>FLOOD THREAT EASES IN SOUTHERN NEW ZEALAND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thousands of people evacuated from
two towns in flood-hit southern New Zealand began returning to
their homes late today as the waters began to recede.
    A state of emergency had been declared in Southland
province apart from the city of Invercargill and its port,
Bluff, as rivers rose over four meters above normal after
torrential rain.
    Local officials in the farming province said stock losses
were "miraculously low" but they expect major crop destruction.
    Roads and rail links were cut and Invercargill airport was
closed. Part of neighbouring Otago province also had a state of
emergency with some rivers well above normal.
