<TITLE>U.K. MONEY MARKET SHORTAGE FORECAST AT 250 MLN STG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it forecast a
shortage of around 250 mln stg in the money market today.
    Among the factors affecting liquidity, it said bills
maturing in official hands and the treasury bill take-up would
drain around 1.02 billion stg while below target bankers'
balances would take out a further 140 mln.
    Against this, a fall in the note circulation would add 345
mln stg and the net effect of exchequer transactions would be
an inflow of some 545 mln stg, the Bank added.
