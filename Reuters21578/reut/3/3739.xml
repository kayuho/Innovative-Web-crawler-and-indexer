<TITLE>SYNERGEN &lt;SYGN&gt; TO MAKE DRUG FOR CIBA-GEIGY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOULDER, Colo., March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Synergen Inc said it agreed to
provide its human elastase inhibitor, designed to treat
emphysema, to Ciba-Geigy AG &lt;CIGZ&gt; for human clinical trials.
    Ciba-Geigy is currently testing the substance in animals,
but the company said the new supplies of the drug will be
suitable for human tests.
    The company said Ciba-Geigy initially licensed the product
in 1985. The new agreement calls for Synergen to set up a
commercial manufacturing process to produce the drug and
deliver quantities to Ciba-Geigy in the second half 1987.
