<TITLE>TWA &lt;TWA&gt; DECLINES COMMENT ON USAIR &lt;U&gt;</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Transworld Airlines Inc official said
the airline has no comment on USAir Group Inc's planned buyout
of Piedmont Aviation Inc.
    TWA, however, has pursued its application with the
Department of Transportation for a takeover of USAir, according
to Mark Buckstein, TWA general counsel and vice president. TWA
filed a revised application today, following the DOT's
rejection Friday of an incomplete application filed last week.
    Earlier USAir said it agreed to buy Piedmont for 69 dlrs
cash per share.
