<TITLE>PITT-DES MOINES &lt;PDM&gt; GETS QUALIFIED AUDIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PITTSBURGH, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pitt-Des Moines Inc said it will
receive a qualified opinion from auditors on its 1986 and 1985
financial statements.
    It said the qualification related to its inability to
determine the effects, if any, of the final resolution of a
suit filed against it by &lt;Washington Public Power Supply
System&gt;.  The 1985 suit was dismissed in a 1986 lower court
action, but the ultimate outcome of the matter is still
uncertain since Washington Public Power has appealed to the
U.S. Court of Appeals.
