<TITLE>DONALD TRUMP TO BUY CROSBY RESORTS &lt;RTB&gt; STOCK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Casino hotel operator and real estate
developer Donald Trump said he has agreed to purchase the Class
B common stock of Resorts International Inc held by the family
and estate of late Resorts chairman James Crosby for 135 dlrs
per share.
    Trump said he is also considering a tender offer for
remaining Class B shares at the same price but has no interest
in Resorts' Class A shares.
    Trump said the shares he has agreed already to buy
represent a 78 pct interest in the Class B stock. The estate
itself owns 340,783 of the 752,297 Class B shares. There are
also about 6,432,000 Class A shares outstanding, but Trump said
"I have no interest in the Class A shares."
    Each Class B share has 100 times the voting power of a
Class A share.
    In Atlantic City, Resorts said in a statement that the
Class B shares being sold to Trump represents 73 pct of the
combined voting power in Resorts.
    It said closing is dependent on receipt of necessary
regulatory approvals and other matters, and after closing,
Trump will tender for remaining Class B shares at the same
price.
