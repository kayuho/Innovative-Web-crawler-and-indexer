<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chrysler Corp said it valued its
proposed buyout of American Motors Corp at 757 mln dlrs, not
counting the effect of a contingent payment that could reach

35 mln dlrs in cash for AMC's finance subsidiary and 200 mln
dlrs in the form of an eight pct note. He said he did not know
