<TITLE>KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN &lt;KSU&gt; MERGER RESPONSE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KANSAS CITY, MO., March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kansas City Southern
Industries Inc said an attempt by Santa Fe Southern Pacific Co
&lt;SFX&gt; to reopen the proposed merger of the Atchison, Topeka and
Santa Fe Railway Co and the Southern Pacific Transportation Co
offers "nothing truly new."
    In a letter to shippers, Kansas City Chairman Landon
Rowland stated "This proposed merger is plainly
anti-competitive, as found by the ICC and urged by the
Department of Justice. Nothing has changed."
    Landon said Kansas City Southern is continuing its efforts
to acquire the transportation operation of Santa Fe Railway.
