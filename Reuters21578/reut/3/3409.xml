<TITLE>BANCROFT &lt;BCV&gt; FILES SUIT AGAINST ZICO</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bancroft Convertible Fund Inc said it
filed a lawsuit in federal court in Newark, N.J., seeking to
block a hostile 30 dlr a share takeover offer by &lt;Zico
Investment Holdings Inc.&gt;
    Bancroft said the suit also names Michael B. Javett,
principal officer of Zico, and First Fidelity Bancorp's &lt;FFB&gt;
First Fidelity Bank unit, the depositary for Zico's offer.
    Bancroft said the suit also names &lt;Georgeson and Co Inc&gt;,
Zico's information agent, and &lt;Luthie Intercontinentale Inc&gt;, a
Panamanian corporation.

that the offer violates the Investment Company Act of 1940.
    The company said its stockholders approved proposals that
will insure that it remains independent.
