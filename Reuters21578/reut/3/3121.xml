<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve is expected to
intervene in the government securities market to add temporary
reserves via customer repurchase agreements, economists said.
    Most economists said the Fed will add 1.5 to two billion
dlrs of temporary reserves via customer repurchase agreements,
but some said there is a slim chance the Fed will inject
permanent reserves via three-day system repurchase agreements.
