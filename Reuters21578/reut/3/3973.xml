<TITLE>SENATOR LUGAR CALLS FOR CARGO PREFERENCE REPEAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>The senior Republican on the U.S.
Senate Agriculture Committee, Richard Lugar of Indiana, called
for repeal of the cargo preference law that aids the American
shipping industry but which he said hurts farmers.
    "Cargo preference is a costly special interest operated at
the expense of American farmers and dockworkers," Lugar said in
signing on as a co-sponsor or cargo preference repeal
legislation.
    The law requires shipment of U.S. goods on American ships
rather than foreign vessels which are less costly.
