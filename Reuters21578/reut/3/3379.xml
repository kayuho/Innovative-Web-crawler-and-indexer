<TITLE>AIRBUS HAS NO COMMENT ON MCDONNELL TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>European consortium Airbus Industrie said
it had no comment on press reports that it had resumed talks
with U.S. McDonnell Douglas Corp over a possible joint
development and production of airliners.
    A spokesman at Airbus headquarters in Toulouse said in a
telephone interview: "We have no knowledge of talks and have no
comment to make."
    Talks broke off last autumn after the two rivals failed to
agree on cooperation over a new long-range jet. McDonnell
Douglas wanted Airbus to help build its MD-11, while Airbus
insisted McDonnell drop the MD-11 and cooperate over its A340.
