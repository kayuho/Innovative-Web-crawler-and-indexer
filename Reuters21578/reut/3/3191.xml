<TITLE>MGE CORN SYRUP FUTURES CONTRACT CLEARS HURDLE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The staff of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, CFTC, recommended that the regulatory
agency approve the Minneapolis Grain Exchange's application to
trade high fructose corn syrup-55, HFCS-55, futures contracts.
    The commission is expected to approve the application at a
meeting tomorrow.
    The proposed contract would provide for the delivery of
48,000 lbs, plus or minus two pct, of bulk HFCS-55, a liquid
food and beverage sweetener produced through processed corn
starch by corn refiners.
    Under proposed rules, a shipping certificate has a limited
life, as it expires 30 days following the last day of trading
of the expiring contract month. A premium charge of 14.40 dlrs
per contract per day would be assessed under the proposal.
