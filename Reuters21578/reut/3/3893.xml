<TITLE>WALL STREET STOCKS/ICH CORP &lt;ICH&gt;</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Louisville, KY, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>ICH Corp's stock
continued under pressure because of lower earnings
expectations, Wall Street analysts said.
    The stock was down one today at 17-1/4, and down about four
since Thursday, when ICH announced it would be reporting
lower-than-expected fourth quarter net income.
    The company said it would report full year 1986 net income
of 2.00 dlrs per share compared to 2.32 dlrs per share in 1985.
Analysts said they had estimated 1987 net at 3.00-4.00 dlrs and
were now looking for at 2.50 dlr to 2.80 dlr range.
    ICH officials were unavailable for comment.
