<TITLE>CHRYSLER &lt;C&gt; TO USE TELECREDIT &lt;TCRD&gt; PRODUCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chrysler Corp said it will use a
product designed by Telecredit Inc's Light Signatures Inc unit
to prevent counterfeit automotive parts.
    Light Signatures will provide coded warranty labels for
Chrysler's replacement parts. The system will first be used for
glass and then expanded to other products.
    Parts replaced by independent repair shops, and containing
the coded warranty label, will be tested by Chrysler dealers to
ensure authenticity.
    The company also said the system will tracks each piece of
warranty glass distributed by Chrysler.
