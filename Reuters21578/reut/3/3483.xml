<TITLE>BELGIAN CENTRAL BANK BUYS CURRENCY TO REPAY DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Belgian National Bank bought
foreign currencies against francs on the open market in the
week ended March 9, a Bank spokesman said.
    In line with central bank policy he declined to give any
details of the amount bought.
    The foreign currency purchased was used by the Treasury to
repay foreign debt and did not affect the Bank's foreign
exchange reserves. They slipped 394 mln francs to 37.33
billion, mostly due to sales of dollars for Special Drawing
Rights, the spokesman said.
