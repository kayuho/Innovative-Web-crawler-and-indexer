<TITLE>MIYAZAWA SAYS PARIS ACCORD HELPING STABILISE RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 10 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the
Paris currency accord has contributed to the stability of
exchange rates.
    Miyazawa told a press conference the agreement reached last
month in Paris by six major industrial nations to cooperate in
bringing about currency stability has prevented speculative
concerns from being active in money centres.
    The decision in Paris is being understood by the market, he
said. The yen-dollar exchange rate has been moving in a narrow
range since finance ministers of Britain, Canada, France,
Japan, the U.S. And West Germany reached the accord.
