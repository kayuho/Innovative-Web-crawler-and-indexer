<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. oil demand as measured by

    In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy

    Gasoline demand averaged 6.75 mln bpd, up 3.3 pct from 6.53

2.7 pct from 1.43 mln, the EIA said.
    Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8.38 mln

crude imports (excluding those for the SPR) averaged 3.67 mln
bpd, up 23 pct from 2.97 mln, the EIA said.
    Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 12.05 mln bpd,
up 1.5 pct from 11.87 mln a year earlier, it said.
    Year-to-date figures will not become available until March
