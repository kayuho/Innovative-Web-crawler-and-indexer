<TITLE>MOODY'S MAY DOWNGRADE CAESARS &lt;CAW&gt; AND UNIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
may downgrade 215 mln dlrs of debt of Caesars World Inc and its
unit Caesars World Finance Corp.
    Moody's said the review was prompted by the recent bid by
investor Martin Sosnoff to acquire control of the company.
While Sosnoff's bid depends on several factors, including
licensing by both the Nevada and New Jersey gaming commissions,
the deal could result in a significant increase in Caesars
World's leverage, the rating agency said.
    Caesars currently carries B-1 convertible debt and the
finance has same-rated subordinated debentures.
