<TITLE>MEATPACKERS STRIKE MORRELL SIOUX CITY PLANT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>About 800 members of the United Food and
Commercial Workers Union, UFCWU, struck John Morrell's Sioux
City, Iowa, pork processing plant at midnight Sunday, a
spokesman for the UFCWU national said.
    Meatpackers at the plant have been working without a
contract since the old pact expired January 31, UFCWU spokesman
John Mancuso said. The plant can slaughter and process about
13,000 to 14,000 hogs a day, he estimated.
    The UFCWU bargaining committee and full membership rejected
in late January a contract proposal by John Morrell, a
subsidiary of United Brands Inc, he said.
