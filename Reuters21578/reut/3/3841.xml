<TITLE>FARAH &lt;FRA&gt; AGAIN OMITS QUARTERLY DIVIDEND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    EL PASO, Texas, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Farah Inc said it omitted its
quarterly common stock dividend for the second consecutive
quarter.
    The company, which last paid a quarterly common dividend of
22 cts a share in December, said it will consider future
dividend payments on the basis of improved profitability and
cash flow.
    Farah said it expects to turn a profit for the balance of
1987. For its first quarter ended January 31, Farah lost
1,891,000 dlrs, or 32 cts a share, on sales of 71 mln dlrs.
    In addition, Farah said it received shareholder approval to
change its name to Farah Inc from Farah Manufacturing Co.
