<TITLE>HENRY ANSBACHER HAS 51 PCT OF ADAMS AND PORTER INC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Henry Ansbacher Holdings Plc&gt; said it
has acquired a 51 pct interest in the U.S. Retail and general
corporate insurance broker &lt;Adams and Porter Inc&gt;.
    The move is the first step in building a new international
insurance broking group following the appointment of a new
management team for its Seascope Insurance Holdings unit.
    Ansbacher said A and P has exciting growth potential,
particularly on the east coast of the U.S. And has an annual
revenue of more than four mln dlrs. Ansbacher shares were up
4-1/2p to 90-1/2, helped by the announcement earlier today of a
1986 pretax profit rise to 5.56 mln stg from 2.74 mln in 1985.
