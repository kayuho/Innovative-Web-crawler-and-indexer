<TITLE>SEAMAN'S STRIKE CONTINUES, MARINES UNLOAD SHIPS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian marines were today
working on the unloading of ships at the local port as a
national strike by 40,000 seamen entered its 10th day without
signs of an agreement.
    The halt, the first national strike by seamen in 25 years,
started on February 27, and union leaders said they would not
return to work unless they received a 275 pct pay rise.
    Shipowners have offered a 100 pct raise, which the seamen
rejected.
    "Television reported that the port was operating at full
speed, but that's not true," a striking seaman told Reuters.
    "The marines are doing their best, but they don't have the
manpower nor the experience to control the situation in such a
quick period," he said.
    Port officials said the national halt had already caused
losses estimated at 1.5 mln dlrs.
    Despite the presence of marines, there were no reports of
incidents.
