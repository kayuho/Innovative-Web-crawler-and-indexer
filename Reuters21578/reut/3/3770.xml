<TITLE>EC CONCERNED OVER U.S. TEXTILE IMPORT MOVES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community (EC) expressed
disquiet over protectionist moves in the United States to limit
imports of textiles and said it would retaliate immediately if
EC exports were hit.
    A spokeswoman for the EC Commission said EC External Trade
Commissioner Willy De Clercq had written to his U.S.
Counterpart, special U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter,
outlining the concerns of the 12-nation Community.
    The draft legislation under consideration by Congress would
impose permanent quotas on products entering the U.S. and seek
to limit any increase to a growth in the overall trade.
