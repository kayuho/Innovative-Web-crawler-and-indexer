<TITLE>CFTC APPROVES MGE CORN SYRUP FUTURES CONTRACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Commodity Futures Trading
Commission has approved the Minneapolis Grain Exchange's
application to trade high fructose corn syrup-55, HFCS-55,
futures contracts, the commission said.
    The contract provides for the delivery of 48,000 lbs, plus
or minus two pct, of bulk HFCS-55 meeting specified standards
regarding its physical and chemical properties.
    CFTC said the exchange plans to begin trading a July 1987
HFCS-55 contract on April 6.
    CFTC said the soft drink industry currently buys at least
95 pct of all U.S.-produced HFCS-55, a liquid food and beverage
sweetener produced through the processing of corn starch by
corn refiners.
