<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Duff and Phelps raised its ratings to
DP-1 (AAA) from DP-2 (high AA) on 2.6 billion dlrs in
debentures and 150 mln dlrs in notes of South Central Bell
Telephone Co, a unit of BellSouth Corp.
    The rating agency cited the company's strong financial
performance, which was achieved by keeping expenses under
control and not by relying on raising local phone rates to its
customers.
