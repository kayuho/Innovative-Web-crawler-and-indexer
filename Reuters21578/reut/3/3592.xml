<TITLE>TRITON ENERGY &lt;OIL&gt; AFFILIATE IN CANADIAN FIND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DALLAS, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Triton Energy Corp said its 70 pct owned
&lt;Canadian Worldwide Energy Ltd&gt; affiliate's Lasmo et al
Tableland 4-36-2-10W2 well in Saskatchewan flowed 567 barrels
of 37 degree gravity oil through a 17/64 inch choke from depths
of 8,531 to 8,548 feet and 636 barrels of oil per day through a
20/64 inch choke from depths of 8,500 to 8,507 feet.
    Triton said because of the well's status as a deep
exploratory well, production qualifies for a five-year royalty
holiday under the Saskatchewan drilling incentive products.
    It said the well's initial production is expected to be
restricted to an allowable level of about 300 barrels a day,
although it is capable of sustaining much higher rates.
    The company said London and Scottish Marine Oil PLC owns a
50 pct interest in the well and its spacing unit, Canadian
Worldwide 25 pct, &lt;Saskatchewan Oil and Gas Corp&gt; 10 pct,
&lt;Interprovincial Pipeline Ltd's&gt; Home Oil Co Ltd 7.5 pct and
Scurry-Rainbow Oil Ltd &lt;SRB&gt; 7.5 pct.
    Triton said Royal Dutch/Shell Group's &lt;RD&gt; &lt;SC&gt; Shell
Canada Ltd &lt;SHC&gt; affiliate retains a convertible overriding
interest in the well.
